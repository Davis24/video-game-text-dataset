He was the original owner of this land. And he did decree that the college be founded so that \"an education in line with the core beliefs of the Order\" could be established for Maryland \"men\". And the reservoir be built to \"serve the moral, intellectual, and practical needs of Maryland\". Like, this guy super had a savior complex.

And for an institution that didn't allow women in until 1920, which, actually that's pretty good. Like that's six years before Sarah Lawrence was established, so, yeah, good on you Kenly College for being ahead of the curve on that one. But, yeah, the reason, the real reason they let women in wasn't because they were super progressive or anything, it's because they needed the money. <br><br>World War I had like totally ravaged the population and there were not a lot of dudes looking to get their education when they were worried about starting families. And those who were were dealing with PTSD and the influenza pandemic that wiped out a lot of potential student bodies. However, there were a lot of spinsters looking to make something of themselves and Kenly capitalized on this new demand for higher learning ladies. In order to go co-ed, two additional dorms were build to house the new students. I mean, it was the roaring twenties but it was still the twenties and like, way before the sexual revolution was even a thing. And it took like another thirty-seven years for Kenly to be like, nah, we don't want to be associated with that creepy ass secret society bs anymore. <br><br>They wanted to appear more modern and liberal and tried to rebrand the college as a bastion for free thinkers and exploration. But, there is still some really jacked up shit in the student code of conduct.

Who is buried in the crypt? Is a crypt a crypt without bodies? Like if the crypt doesn't have bodies is it just a basement?
