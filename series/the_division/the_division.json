What do you need to make a cup of coffee? Beans, water, a means to apply heat, and a vessel to contain the brew. If you're like most New Yorkers, that heat comes from your coffeepot, which also that vessel. So let's break it down.<br><br><br> Coffee does not grow in New York, or anywhere within approximately 3,000 miles of New York. So your cup of coffee is dependent first and foremost on TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS. If you buy beans at your local coffee shop or grocery store, they probably came out of 100-point bags that arrived at a CONTAINER PORT via ship from one of the equatorial coffee-growing zones. From there, the coffee was loaded onto TRUCK that entered either over a BRIDGE or through a TUNNEL into Manhattan, where the coffee was delivered to its final destination. Along the way, the beans might have been separated into smaller 12- or 16- ounce bags for retail sale. That would take place in a warehouse, probably somewhere in Queens or New Jersey. If you buy your coffee from a larger commercial provider, bagging (or grinding and canning ) likely took place at larger factory before shipping. Either way, a lot has already happened to your beans before they get to your kitchen counter.<br><br><br> Once your have the coffee, you also need water. New York City's WATER SUPPLY comes to Manhattan via two large pipes, imaginatively known as Water Pipe Number 1 and Water Pipe Number 2. From there it moves through a series of smaller mains and local pipes to your faucet. Because the city's RESERVOIRS are in the Catskills, as much as 125 miles away and 300 feet above sea level, gravity provides enough water pressure to deliver water up to approximately six stories on the island of Manhattan.

When the world is ending, it's okay to talk to yourself.<br><br><strong> Guidebook:</strong><br><br> INTRODUCTION<br><br> This book was born out of my dissatisfaction with existing survival guides. Most of them focus on singular catastrophes that occur in a matter of minutes or hours, requiring immediate or short-term responses. That kind of preparations and awareness is useful, but it doesn't address another kind of potential situation: Namely the kind of disaster that no one is prepared for, a full-on collapse - the end of the world, or at least that's how it would seem if you were in the middle of it. That would demand a different kind of preparation. One way to think about it is to ask yourself these questions: What would I do if I knew help wasn't coming in the aftermath of a catastrophic event? What would I do if I knew I had to survive on my own?<br><br><br> It is difficult to conceptualize a plan for this kind of disaster, because when everything is falling apart - and I mean everything, as you will see when I break down scenarios later in the book - planning breaks down too. How do you plan on not being able to plan? Consider the fact that we have a hurricane evacuation and response plans, but we don't seem to be doing anything about climate change, which will likely create more and stronger hurricanes. Why? Because one is an easily defined event with a beginning (the hurricane), middle (response and reconstruction), and end (restoration of normalcy.) The other is a long-term problem with a number of potential consequences, requiring fundamental changes in the way that we do things. Those changes are hard to make because the reasons for them aren't immediately clear. Human beings are very good at responding to immediate threats and very poor planning for long-term consequences.<br><br><br> Why is that an issue? Because it's a long-term problem that destroys civilizations. Even the most devastating single event is surmountable.<br><br><strong> April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text in black pen:</strong><br><br> 12/3<br><br> [nine hash marks]<br><br><strong> April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text in blue pen:</strong><br><br> 12/12<br><br> [eleven hash marks]<br><br><strong> April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text in orange pen:</strong><br><br> 12/23<br><br> [one hash mark]<br><br><strong> April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text in red pen:</strong><br><br> 12/24<br><br> [seven hash marks]<br><br><strong> April's text in pencil:</strong><br><br> 12/31<br><br> [seven hash marks]<br><br><strong> April's text in brown pen:</strong><br><br> 1/7<br><br> [one hash mark]<br><br> choices were: pink or brown", "authors": ["April Kelleher"]}, {"id": 26696, "title": "Page 53", "text": "<strong>Guidebook:</strong><br><br> Important papers - They're only important if normalcy is going to be restored quickly.
