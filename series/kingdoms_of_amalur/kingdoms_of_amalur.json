S/He was taken to the Primos, where, for the first time in many years, the leader of the Kollossae people spoke. His name was Anokatos, and he immediately recognized our hero/ine as Beckoned. He took this as a sign that his penance was over, and the first course of action was to create the Wreath of Absolution.\n\nThe wreath required the Beckoned to retrieve the circlet of Arkes, the former Primos, from a crypt below the city. Fetching a circlet from under-sewers does not sound like the work of a hero/ine, and indeed it wasn't meant to be. The circlet was needed immediately, and, as I understand it, the menial nature of the task was part of the point. Humility was needed for the Kollossae to atone for their sins.\n\nAfter the circlet, the Beckoned travelled with the Primos to the wilds of the Teeth of Naros to hunt the Alpha pteryx. With the circlet and the vanes of the Alpha pteryx the Wreath of Absolution was complete, and Anokatos and the Beckoned would use the Cipher to open the door to the Hyperian, and then cause it to rise and join Idylla in the sky, thus completing the works of Ethene and bringing about the promised glory of the Kollossae.\n\nThe Beckoned accompanied Anokatos to the Hyperian complex. Secandra was summoned there as well, and once the ceremony to open the way to the Hyperian was complete, both of them were betrayed by Anokatos. They were able to escape, but only to find the city in peril and the promise of disaster rumbling throughout the land.

Universally adapted as a staple in any kitchen of means, the chicken has proven its ability to thrive anywhere with minimal tending. Why, then have so few of us learned folk devoted a tome, or even at least a passage or mention, to the noble animal?\n\nI aim to correct that now. I will conduct an unflinching and holistic analysis of the jungle fowl commonly referred to as \"chicken.\" And, like any sane practitioner of science, I will begin my study with an anatomy of the graceful creature and its behavior.\n\nThe most prominent feature of the chicken is, of course, its comb. Colloquially known as a scab-ridge or mitharu's mistake, this floppy mantle of flesh is actually referred to in learned circles as the grossia major (in roosters) and grossia minor (in hens). Many have puzzled over the purpose of these growths, with many attributing them to some tool for communication. But that makes little sense - do not chicks need to communicate? Why don't they have little grossia majors and minors as well? No, the chicken's comb is far more likely a vestigial rest used to be used in fending off predators and navigating their original habitats - oceans. Notice how the folds and contours of these growths resemble the fins of aquatic fauna? It is no coincidence.\n\nThere are not only physical characteristics that chickens are reputed for. The chickens - specifically, roosters - are reputed for the diligence they employ when signalling the start of the day. While the degree to which they participate in this behavior is somewhat exaggerated, these reports are based in truth. Roosters are eager to announce the start of every new day, but this behavior goes unexplained. Perhaps they are relishing the opportunity to mate for another day? Perhaps they have an affinity for Helius, god of the sun? In the end, it is unknown.\n\nAnd the most valuable commodity of the chicken is, ofcourse, its eggs. They are a lifeblood for the peasants and nobleman of Amalur alike, for it is their nourishment that gets us through the days and evenings. But why do chicken lay eggs in such quantities? Is it to ensure that at least some offsprings survive? Instead, I believe that chickens have behaviorally altered their egg laying physiology, colloquially known as an ovipositor matricula, to produce a surplus of offspring as a means of raising their race's global population. No doubt the beasts flourish in captivity, but they desire the freedom of their wild ancestors. It must be their hope, then, that drives them to flood the world with their kind, to the point where ownership becomes meaningless and they are set free.", "authors": ["Unknown  "]}, {"id": 13685, "title": "Explorer's Journal V", "text": "Entry V\n\nI am lucky enough to have undone the violet cage, though the process in doing so took far longer than I thought it would.

Her evil stepmother had put a wicked spell on her father and forced him to give away his daughters hand, for her stepmother only desired the fortune the family would gain from the wedding. But our princess desired the attention of another man...\n\nThe man the princess' heart belonged to was but the local grain-cook, a man of simple upbringing who wooed the princess during her daily trips to the local market. He was entranced by her beauty from the fist time they met. Both the princess and the lowly grain-cook knew their stations would preclude any thought of marriage, so they kept their love a secret. They promised each other that, no matter what happened, they would always love and trust each other. But a year before the wedding the evil stepmother discovered the lovers and locked the princess away...\n\nFurious, the grain-cook stormed the castle and confronted the stepmother. Knowing he had to be cordial, he pleaded with her to let him see his imprisoned love. After hours of listening the pleas of the depressed grain-cook, the stepmother agreed to allow them to meet. Under guarded watch the beautiful princess and the upset grain-cook were allowed to see each other one last time. At twenty paces, allowed neither to touch nor speak, they could only stare into each other's eyes wishing there was something they could do. The grain-cook was permitted to give the princess a bowl of his sumptuous food, in exchange for agreeing to never come again.\n\nThe princess began to starve herself, refusing all food unless it was cooked grain - like the kind her lover left. Knowing that the wedding fortune would be lost if the princess were to die, the stepmother begrudgingly agreed to the demands. To infuriate the grain-cook more, the stepmother decided that she herself would pick up the grain and deliver them to the princess. The stepmother ordered that no one be allowed to talk to the princess, save for her. Every day, she would descend to the dungeon where the princess waited, and said to her, \"For the rest of your life may you think about what you have done.\"\n\nAfter a year the wedding the princess had dreaded had finally arrived. Her betrothed waited anxiously at the altar for his first glimpse at his gorgeous princess that he had bought. The musicians began their songs, the guests rose to their feed and a shadow was seen at the back of the cathedral. The princess stepped into the room slowly. First only her little toes, followed by her leg, and then walked into the room to the sound of gasps. The once petite princes had quadrupled in size...\n\nThe princess, known for her subtle beauty had become lumpy and smelled of stale chaff. Her fianc&eacute; no longer had the desire to marry her. He raised his hand to quiet the bewildered congregation and sent both the stepmother and princess back to their kingdom. The stepmother furious that the princess had ruined the marriage, ordered all fields of grain to be burned and all stockpiled grain to be sold, regardless of cost.\n\nHer heart swollen with the loss of such wealth, the stepmother began calculating new ways to earn her vaunted fortune. She eventually decreed that whomever could pay the price of one thousand gold bars could not only have the princess as his wife, but would their family's rank lifted to the level of royalty. With word of the princess' loss of beauty there was only one suitor that requested her hand - but he had sent a courier to deliver the news. He requested that neither the queen nor the bride must see him before the wedding. One hundred gold bars were to be delivered daily to the castle until the day of their marriage. A carriage arrived carrying the suitor for morning of the wedding and from it a familiar-looking man emerge. It was the grain-cook.\n\nDue to the sudden loss of the grain fields, grain had skyrocketed to be worth its weight in gold. And no one has more grain than a grain cooker. \"Do you still love me?\" asked the princess, \"Even with my misshapen figure?\" \"Of course\" replied the savvy gran-cook. The princess, ecstatic to see her true love once more, tore the bottom of her dress. Out poured a mixture of old cook grain and the crumpled messages of longing the cook had hidden in each bag of grain sent to the princess. She was once again as beautiful as the day they first met. As they embraced for the first time in years her father realized the error of his ways. The sight of seeing his daughter truly happy had released him from the torturous spell. The angered king ordered the stepmother be sent to the guillotine. As they dragged her away the princess looked at her and said \"For the rest of your life may you think about what you have done.\" That day the lovers were married and lived happily ever after...

One month, and yet an eternity. I have changed so much.\n\nIt began as a night like any other. We had spent the evening reading by the fire, I a treatise on Alfar ward magic, she one of those romantic fictions I found so irritating and for which I often mercilessly teased her. It was a simple night, a night of which we had enjoyed a hundreds of times before. A night the likes of which we thought we would enjoy hundreds of times yet.\n\nAnd yet ... it was not meant to be. Sometime in the night, peacefully, her heart gave out. She died in quiet, and I awoke alone.\nWhat a moment that was for me. It was a moment of great pain, and grief, and then finally, of transformation. In that moment I was forced to confront the thirty-two yearts we had spent together. Thirty-two years of laughter and love, of humility and quiet and companionship.\n\nI loved her so much.. I can see her face the day we met. I had been in Rathir, a young man still, studying for my entrance exams to the Scholia Arcana. My instructors called me gifted with regard to trasnformation and constructive magics - I thought I had a promising career ahead in the contemplative world of the arcane. I hoped to one day build great wonders.\n\nThat day I was running late to my initiation trial, so I cut across a lawn and through an alley I had never braved before. And standing there upon the street corner as I emerged was the loveliest of angels, selling flowers from a basket at her hip. She was from Emaire, I would later find out- she had made the trek with armful of irises in the hopes that she might see the big city and have a taste of some adventure.\nI watched her momentarily, my initiation trial forgotten. Then with an uncharacteristic courage, I strode forward and solicited her attention for a moment. She undoubtledly found me gangly and unimpressive in my robes, but when I drew a violet flower from her bundle and asked her name, she grew quiet. \"Jane,\" she hesitantly whispered. I can still see her half smile, uncertain in the bright Rathir sunshine.\nAnd with a flourish, I drew my ink-stained fingers up and down the flower stem, consuming the thing in a flash of fire. My hands flew apart as flames gently wafted upward, spelling out her name. Her eyes grew bright at the silly display for which my teachers would undoubtedly scold me, and as she began to ask how the trick was done, I pulled another iris from my sleeve, this one the color of a sunset, red and gold an blue, the color of flame itself.\n\"Then please accept this, dear Jane.\" I paused, my breath shallow. \"Its beauty, like yours, will never fade.\" In retrospect, I was a horribly romantic youth.\n\nAnd I never made it to my initation trial.\n\nDo I regret the thirty-two years I spent with Jane? I dare not. But at the same time, I realize now that she only held me back from my full potential. For certain I continued to pursue my arcane crafts. But alone, a tinkerer and an enthusiast and a seller of trinkets, I could never reach my full potential. In that moment when she was gone, it was as if a part of me died with her, A part, I think, that had kept me in check. A part called restraint.\n\nAnd what wonders I can work, now! At first my grief and my pain found outlet in the craft room, and I began to build bigger and more ambitious constructs- my spells more dangerous and more ambitious. But after only seven days did I begin to conceive the theretofore inconceivable- that I might use the growing magic within my person to reconstruct and reanimate my fallen wife.\n\nNecromancy, my teachers would call it, among other less savory terms. It is a magic taboo, a forbidden art.. an art for which I found myself aptly suited. It was, of course, the gravest of mistakes. Jane's soul is gone- her body, imbuued with a force born from my very misery and solitude, may walk and talk, may breathe and blink and eat, but it is not alive.\n\nPerhaps that is as well. The magic grows within me, and reason wanes. I can feel myself slipping further each day, lost perhaps to my art, perhaps simply to melancholia. Boundaries are gone; sense has fled.\n\nBut at least my promise to Jane will remain- now, like the iris I gifted her that day so long ago, her beauty will never fade.", "authors": ["Patrick Morkan"]}, {"id": 13698, "title": "Tyr's Journal II", "text": "Journal of Tyr Magnus\n\nFather's greatsword, the Gentleman's Favor, has been stolen.

Bordered by the enigmantic Odarath, the notorious Webwood, and the enchanted Glendara, Yolvan is known primarily as the bastion of \"natural\" creatures in these lands. And while bears, wolves, and antelope are certainly to be found here, the area is not as devoid of more magical forms of life. In fact, it is sometimes a common occurrence to see sprites attacking packs of wolves, or bears doing battle with the odd troll that has stumbled into their den. This dichotomy is even more apparent when one considers the fact that the Warsworn keep a base in a stronghold here, within eyeshot of the mystical fae institution known as the House of Ballads. And, while interactions (if any) between the two groups are often genial enough, it is curious to note the tension between the natural and unnatural in Yolvan.\n\nThe area is actually rather small -- which some have attributed to the spread of the more magical forests, exacerbated by what many perceive to be a rise in magic -- but noticeable for the sudden drop of the tree-line. There are large expanses of ruins, similar to those found in Lorca-Rane, but whose origins remain rather mysterious. They do not resemble fae architecture, or Erathi, or those of the stronghold in the region. But they are known to house a few secrets to be uncovered by those brave enough to explore them.\n\nAlas, what more can be said of Yolvan?

Onesimos is a feared debater and often utilizes 'the topic in discussion where he explains courage as the result of power. As I see it, playwright Straton's \"The 'Opponent\" appears to be an examination of courage, as well, through a simple parable. According to the playwright, courage 'is not a result of power, but the means to it. He seems to question the usefulness of strength if one lacks the bravery to 'use it. The protagonist of \"The Opponent\" is Theron, who wages a war against a cunning antagonist called Taruk, a Niskaru 'Tyrant. As a Mairu, Theron is a savage, whose cares begin and end with battle, though he has moments of ingenuity that 'connect him to the Kollassae of today.\n\nAt the climax of \"The Opponent\" we see Theron's village in flames, decimated by Taruk, though not without a price: the 'Mairu appear to have beaten, their aggressor. Taruk is surrounded, and, apparently, defeated, as the village leader stands 'over the Tyrant's skull. Unfortunately Taruk has a final spell to cast, and with a click of his mandibles, his form 'dissolves as he possesses one of the villagers, the wife of the village leader. In that moment, it seems the Mairu are 'utterly defeated. No one dares attack the wife of the village leader, and the night air fills with the shrill laughter of 'the possessed woman&mdash;laughter that turns to a cry of pain and terror as Theron strikes her down with a club of his own.\n\nInstantly The Niskaru leaps into the body of a new host, and instantly Theron strikes him down. The vicious cycle continues 'until Theron is finally possessed, when he is the last Mairu standing. \"I have you now,\" Taruk gloats, speaking with 'Theron's voice. But in reply, Theron raises his club, and readies to smash his own face. Taruk flees from the Mairu's 'body in terro, taking coporeal form once more, and runs for a nearby river. Theron gives chase, and drowns the demon in 'the very river he sought to escape by.\n\nIn the epilogue, we learn that the only two of the villagers are fatally wounded by Theron's hand, and the rest will 'recover.

Any argument not grounded in hard, irrefutable facts is not worth being made, fought for or upheld, according to them.\n\nBut there is a world beyond the syllogism, beyond the progressions of postulates and conclusions of discourses. And, perhaps most importantly, there exist people over whom fact holds no meaning. It is in these times that a knowledge of rhetoric -- of stance, elocution and dramatization -- can reign.\n\nAnother oft-given reason for the avoidance of studying rhetoric, made by the scribes and aides of the Domus Politica, is the insistence that knowledge of rhetoric might somehow corrupt or otherwise pollute the moral fiber of the one that employs it. Surely, such detractors suggest, that just as martial or financial power stokes the flame of ambition in those who wield it, so could the power of influence wielded by a rhetorician give way to equally rampant ambition. Against such claims I can only stand with mouth agape.\n\nRhetoric is a product of our enlightened minds -- to compare it with martial authoritarianism or the practice of usury, to present it as merely another avenue for one being to express dominance over another, is wholly absurd. True, rhetoric is a means to an end. But to achieve mastery over rhetoric, one must open one's mind to a corpus of the finest works these lands have to offer -- \"The Missgivings,\" by Ballarde Oreigh, Decanus Kerine's \"Twenty-Five-and-One Supports,\" -- and internalize them. To excel at rhetoric is to be worldly; to be persuasive, one must examine issues from all sides. (And to those that are easily persuaded by even an amateur, I might argue that they are asking to be taken advantage of!)\n\nIn light of such a testament, then -- in the understanding that rhetoric requires such a breadth of knowledge -- how can my opponents presume to know that rhetoric will yield to corruption?

I do not intent to disappoint him. As is our tradition, the foundation of this keep shall be build from the very ships that brought us hence. Their masts will support the ceiling of the Great Hall, the sails shall be the canopies of our courtyard.\n\nSecond Entry: The forest itself seems to oppose us. We cannot build fast enough to to[sic] keep apace with its growth. Every morning, it has reclaimed nearly all that was done they day prior. I need more men.\n\nThird Entry: I believe I, at last, have enough strong backs to make some headway against this island wilderness. I've never seen such trees as these. They seem to visibly grow in a moment, leaning not towards the sun, but solely towards our keep, so bent do they seem on its destruction.\n\nFourth Entry: This island has never seen the likes of a Dvergan builder and what he can do with an army of strong Dvergan men and slaves from distant lands. Our work might have failed without these first batches of slaves brought here by Lord Gravehal for the slave colony he builds in the harbor on the western coast. Once I am done with whatever is left of this batch, Lord Gravehal believes he can make this place center of the Frostbreak Sea slave trade.\n\nFifth Entry: The island trembles under the points of our shovels and the speed of our axes, though it seems to fight back with all its might. It unnerves me to imagine what force opposes me, but I am no less determined to conquer it. Even Lord Gravehal himself, at his advanced age, lends his strong back to the effort. Every day he doffs his finery and toils for hours, shirtless in the frigid air.\n\nSixth Entry: Lord Gravehal has died. With hammer raised high above his head, he thundered down upon the high wall of the tower, driving in one final nail for the day. The scaffold, it was slippery this day, and his lordship lost his footing and fell to the frozen ground. Lady Gravehal has ordered what she calls \"our folly\" abandoned, and we immediately set sail for Emberdeep.\n\nSeventh Entry: Lord Gravenhal's only son, Ansgar Solsvard, heir to Gravenhal has sworn that we shall never abandon his father's keep and it be completed in his memory. Lady Gravehal has no choice but to comply. Work resumes.\n\nEighth Entry: It is done. The throne room is a sight to behold, outshining any in Emberdeep. The master of the keep's throne looks down upon the long table, beside staircases winding awesomely and mysteriously to the gallery above. The wood within has been polished to an ethereal shine and the rugs upon the floor are of the softest wool imaginable, shorn from this island's many creatures. Outside, the courtyard bustles in the shadow of the wall and its massive carvings. Stalls line the yard selling all manner of wares from across the sea, before the backdrop of the keep, in the center, and the library and the household of his lordship's bride-to-be, Lady on either side. Her chambers would be considered a palace in any other place. Crawling as it will be with filthy animals, is a jewel of its kind, functional and perfectly suited to its purpose, if I may say.\n\nMy finest work is at last complete an arrangements can now be made for the wedding and the opening of the mighty keep of Gravehal.

Onesimos is a feared debater and often utilizes the topic in the discussions where he explains courage as the result of power. As I see it, playwright Straton's \"The Opponent\" appears to be an examination of courage, as well, through a simple parable.\n\nAccording to the playwright, courage is not a result of power, but the means to it. He seems to question the usefulness of strength if one lacks the bravery to use it. The protagonist of \"The Opponent\" is Theron, who wages war against a cunning antagonist called Taruk, a Niskaru Tyrant. As a Mairu, Theron is a savaege whose cares begin and end with battle, though he has moments of ingenuity that connect him to the Kollossae of today.\nAt the climax of \"The Opponent\", we see Theron's village in flames, decimated by Taruk, though not without a price: the Mairu appear to have beaten their aggressor. Taeruk is surrounded, and apparently, defeated, as the village leader stands over the Niskaru with a club leveled at the Tyrant's skull.\n\nUnfortunately, Taruk has a final spell to cast, and with a click of his mandibles his form dissolves as he possesses one of the villagers the wife of the village leader. In that moment, it seems thr Mairu are utterly defeated. No one dares attack the wife of the village leader, and the night air fills with the shrill laughter od the possessed woman -- laughter that turns into a cry of pain and terror as Theron strikes her down with a club of his own.\n\nInstantly the Niskaru leaps into the body of a new host, and instantly Theron strikes him down. The vicious cycle continues until Theron is finally possessed, when he is the last Mairu standing. \"I have you now,\" Taruk gloats, speaking with Theron's voice. But in reply, Theron raises his club, and readies to smash his own face. Taruk flees from the Mairu's body in terror, taking corporeal form once more, and runs for a nearby river. Theron gives chase, and drowns the demon in the very river he sought to escape by.\n\nIn the epilogue, we learn that only to of the villagers are fatally wounded by Theron's hand, and the rest will recover. It is obvious that Theron's Mairu tendencies have saved the village.

The word Varani is derived from the Jottun word for traveler or trader, and despite many attempts by Almain, Alfar and others to bring the Varani' under their influence, they have remained independent from any government. It is said that the desire to avoid governance is what drove the Varani away from the human kingdoms of the Almain and Bassawin. As such, the 'Varani are to be found inhabiting islands off the coast as much as the coast itself.\n\nVarani Appearance\n\nThe Varani are similar to Almain in average size, and are typically more fair-skinned and fair-haired. They often feature elaborate tattoos or jewelry to accent their otherwise practical cold-weather clothing. Their garments are made to withstand the rigors of sea travel, as well as the cold of the Icebrine Coast, from whence they originate. Jewelry is usually made from gold, and nobles often wear silks or pelts as well. The influence of other cultures can easily be seen in their manner of dress, including the rich colors of the Alfar. Varani men usually groom long beards and sometimes braid them, and the Varani women traditionally plait their hair.\n\nVarani Society\n\nThe Varani are a mostly nomadic, seafaring people found along the Icebrine Coast and other lands along the northern coast. They have small settlements that serve as trading outposts, but are merchant sailors more than farmers or fishermen. Varani society is a non-gender-based meritocracy. All roles aboard ship are valued, and while they may not all be equal, they are not without their place and purpose. The Varani believe that anyone who is cunning, and able to hold his or her own deserves a place aboard a ship. The Varani are not as religious as the Almain, but they are considered very superstitious. The use charms and amulets to ward off evil.

The Alfar settled in what is called Glen Suthain, and the Ljosalfar established civilization in the heart of that country. The Dokkalfar looked beyond the cold chill of Glen Suthain and encouraged expansion into other parts of the world. The more conservative Ljosalfar instead preferred the natural beauty of the forests they found in Glen Suthain. The Alfar lived side by side for many years, and watched as the other races began to build their small civilizations. The elves, especially the Ljosalfar, came to love the frozen lands that surrounded them. They first build Fierol, and later a city named Tolyndrae to the east of Glen Suthain. The Ljosalfar only entered the Faelands with the Dokkalfar, remaining an unique relationship despite their philosophical differences.\n\nLjosalfar Appearance\n\nLjosalfar are taller than most humans with pale, silky skin and light hair. They appear lithe, but are not a frail race by any means. The Ljosalfar have very strong ties to nature, and as such they tend to embrace the colours that are dominant in their surroundings: whites, blues, pinks and yellows. Ljosalfar nobles and merchants also employ regal colors and hues in their clothing. The Ljosalfar do not wear clothing especially suited to the cold of their homeland, having become naturally acclimated to the weather and using magic to supplement their resistance to extreme temperatures.\n\nLjosalfar Society\n\nThe Alfar people are closely attuned to the magical forces of the world, and the Ljosalfar are no exception. Some of the most powerful mages in Amalur were Ljosalfar, and it was indeed the Ljosalfar who first taught humans to wield the arcae at the beginnings of this Age of Arcana. Similar to the Almain, the Ljosalfar value order and structure and have appropriately regimented societies. Chief among Ljosalfar values is the idea of Justice, and the worship of Ynadon, their god of justice. For example, the Ljosalfar order known as the Justicars are a group of travelling judicial monks who resolve disputes and pass judgement on legal matters. For details on the Justicars and the Ljosalfar religion, the prime work is known as the High Law. The Ljosalfar are distinct from the Dokkalfar in that while they worship and appreciate Lyria as a Goddess of Magic and Luck, they do not see either as an end unto themselves. Both are means to achieve a just and right state. The religious leader of the Ljosalfar is called the Scion, a female child of the royal line who is raised and protected by the Justicars.\n\nDedicated to the service of Ynadon, she is viewed as living incarnation of the blind impartiality of justice and serves as the equivalent of the high priestess of the Justicars.", "authors": ["Lexius the Old "]}, {"id": 13771, "title": "Tari's Note", "text": "A shabby note scrawled in the hand of the common born.\n\nDear Stranger,\n\nPlease, show pity.

He told them of a great power, capable of freeing them from their earthly constraints. He promised eternal life, and the power to transcend the mundane reality thrust upon them by the Great Cycle. Some believed him, and soon Fahrlang had gathered a host of devoted servants, the Fahrlangi. Elsewhere in the Faelands, Eagonn and the Firstsworn battled demons, unaware of the threat of Fahrlang and his followers. Their exploits are well known to all: how Edorias slew Torek'zor; how Lyana survived the demon walk; and how Argul repelled the host of Zandrokar. Fahrlang saw this chance to strike, and with his fanatical devotees, he began the spell that would summon the most terrible of demon lords, Khamazandu.\n\nTeodar of the mountains, who often climbed their heights, came across the mage's summoning. He spied the forces gathering, and knew that doom would soon be at hand. With a calm and steady mind, and a bravery of composure, descended the mountainside and went to Andurin, the great blacksmith of Detyre.\n\n\"O mighty Andurin, whose hammer never falters, whose anvil withstands the strongest of blows, I implore you now, for the sake of Amalur, throw down your earthly works and craft a hammer worthy of the dauntless Eagonn\"\n\n\"If it is a hammer capable of defeating Fahrlang that you require, bring me the plans from Eamonn himself, for only his knowledge can defeat the power of the Niskaru.\"\n\nSo Teodar retrieved the Sage's knowledge, and thus did Anduri begin to craft the Mystic Hammer. While Andurin worked the anvil, and Vlaskar kept the forge, Teodar went to Eagonn, who battled demons on the battlefields of Erathell. Teodar knew no sleep nor pause until he was by Eagonn's side. He told Eagonn of the threat, but Eagonn would not retreat from the battle.\n\n\"If I abandon the field we will lose this war, and the demon will destroy us all,\" he said.\n\n\"I will lead the battle while you conquer this evil,\" cried Teodar above the din of swords and demon howls.\n\nThis was Teodar's last act as Firstsworn. He fell defending the Plains of Erathell, holding the Niskaru at bay so Eagonn could vanquish Fahrlang and his followers. Upon his grave, he was honored with the title of Leoden: the leader of the Firstsworn, a shining example of sacrifice for all those who are sworn to war.", "authors": ["Unknown  "]}, {"id": 13778, "title": "Might Proves Virtue", "text": "An essay by Onesimos, master of the Lykeios.\n\nMight Proves Virtue: A Scholarly Thesis\n\nThese are uncertain times, Kollossae magic has proven ineffective in the raising of the Hyperian. Citizens of Idylla have left the city to re-enter the wild, like the Mairu, disenchanted as they are with life here. The political and social enemies of the Lykeios are emerging once again, claiming to be \"casual observers\" who ask why it is necessary to maintain an academy such as ours in Idylla. There are many among the nobles and the guards who relish the idea of turning our humble school into another shimmering tower or a barracks for the military. They think only of elevating the city, always conceiving taller buildings, instead of elevating their cultivation and their way of thinking. Every day, I strive to convince them of the error of their ways, and my arguments fall to ears deafened by foolishness. If I cannot convince them, I must convince you, dear reader, that institutions such as the Lykeios are necessary for the continued evolution of our people, especially in the light of our failing at the Hyperian. We cannot lift the Hyperian if we are not enlightened, and we require the Lykeios, along with the study of theology through debate, to attain enlightenment.\n\nBut how, you ask? With a single rule: Every debate that takes place in the Lykeios is unified by the agreement that might proves virtue, and, as all know, the virtuous are correct. The purpose of the debates then, is to present social arguments and let the virtuous resolve them. The two debaters articulate their points, they discuss the opposing views in light of each other, along with tangential proofs, and then, the exclamation point, the great finish, wherein they determine the victor, is decided as a Kollossae decides all things: with power. Every debate thus exists as a microcosm of a Kollossae life, discovering the dangers of the world, ruminating on how to overcome, and then battling them until one either falls or truimphs. The Lykeios debate is an elegant convention, and I implore you to experience it before it is too late. In our waning influence, the Lykeios may soon be reduced to a government building or a misshapen hut to house soldiers.\n\nMorning debates are about to begin, and so I must conclude by imploring you, dear reader: when next you hear some poor fool disparaging the Lykeios, think of what it is that makes you who you are, that allows you to be counted among the lineage of the great Hero himself. It is not your might, as the Mairu had might to spare, but it is your cultivation, your virtue, that makes you so.

The giant spider is a well-known creature in the lands of Amalur, and rightfully so -- fast and graceful on eight legs, fangs full of poison, capable of shooting inescapable webs -- for the spider is one of the deadliest predators one can regularly expect to encounter.\n\nIt is rather embarrassing, but for as many opportunities we have to study these creatures, we still have no idea why they are so large. Perhaps to avoid predation? The new, and most attractive, theory attributes their prodigious size to the recent growth of magic in Amalur. I am inclined to agree with this -- simply because the weight of its exoskeleton would crush the beast if it left to ordinary physical forces.\n\nThe giant spider is also extraordinary because it can exhibit a wide array of predatory behavior, whereas most of its smaller relatives stick to a specific pattern of hunt. They can burrow very quickly underground, in order to ambush enemies by erupting from the soil - a behavior seen previously in the tarantulas of the Bassowin territory -- as well as the typical poison-laced bite. But perhaps the most terrifying tool at there* disposal is actively shooting web silk at their foes.

Any argument not grounded in hard, irrefutable facts is not worth being made, fought for or upheld, according to them.\n\nBut the is a world beyond the syllogism, beyond the progressions of postulates and conclusions of discourses. And, perhaps most importantly, there exist people over whom fact holds no meaning. It is in these times that a knowledge of rhetoric -- of stance, elocution and dramatization -- can reign.\n\nAnother oft-given reason for the avoidance of studying rhetoric, made by the scribes and aides of the Domus Politica, is the insistence that knowledge of rhetoric might somehow corrupt or otherwise pollute the moral fiber of the one that employs it. Surely, such detractors suggest, that just as martial or financial power stokes the flame of ambition in those who wield it, so could the power of influence wielded by a rhetorician give way to equally rampant ambition.\n\nAgainst such claims I can only stand with mouth agape.\n\nRhetoric is a product of our enlightened minds -- to compare it with martial authoritarianism or the practice of usury, to present it as merely another avenue for one being to express dominance over another, is wholly absurd. True, rhetoric is a means to an end. But to achieve mastery over rhetoric, one must open one's mind to a corpus of the finest works these lands have to offer-- \"The Missgivings,\" by Ballarde Oreigh, Decanus Kerrine's \"Twenty-Five-and-One Supports,\" -- and internalize them. To excel at rhetoric is to be worldly; one must examine issues from all sides. (And to those that are easily persuaded by even an amateur, I might argue that they are asking to be taking advantage of!)\n\nIn light of such a testament, then -- in the understanding that rhetoric requires such a breadth of knowledge -- how can my opponents presume to know that rhetoric will yield to corruption? How can a mind that has seen so much, studied great works and diversified their perception to such ends, fall to base temptation?

Such is the case with Playwright Straton's newest production, which tells the tale of a wretched man, a Kollossae by the name of Timos, ion a play that lasts for over eleven hours. Timos, the eponymous character, struggles with mental illness -- a madness that burdens his family, destroys his profession, and eventually claims his life. \n\nI struggled to discern the message of the twelve-hour epic: was Timos's sickness a metaphor for the coddling of the modern Kollossae in the midst of current conveniences? Was it commentary that the natural savagery of the Mairu still exists within us, to be battled on a daily basis? In the end, I could come to no conclusion. The message was lost in too many details.\n\nThe play is written in a moment-to-moment telling of the events, and takes place over the course of twelve hours, where we learn of Timos' past as he expounds it in the present, about to be executed for crimes he committed under his derangement.\n\nInscrutable moments in the production were many. There was an instance when the narrative itself seemed to suffer a psychotic episode. Timos, whose madness has driven him to believe that he has become a Pteryx, removes all of his clothing, and proceeds to assault the town guards, the executioners, claiming that his majestic beak shall rip apart their entrails. At that moment, the torches dim, and the tragedian portraying Timos is replaced by an actual Pteryx, obviously captured from the Teeth of Naros itself. The fowl tragedian proceeded to attack his fellow actors along with members of the crowd who stood to close. In the end, the cast, with members of the audience and Straton himself, managed to slay the Pteryx. It way a rousing end to a rather drab experience, but again, it was completely devoid of meaningful narrative.\n\nOf course, most of the audience enjoyed the performance, anyway.

A Varani shaper, he came to Erathell from far to the North, searching the world for the knowledge of stone. After refusing to build a temple in Sydanus' name, he was cast into prison.\n\nThe second was a Gnome named Marus Torix. A gifted gnosicant, he had long ago left the safety and comfort of his libraries to travel the world, to learn of things with his own eyes. For teaching a doctrine different from the unquestioning worship of Sydanus and her regime, he, too, was cast into prison.\n\nThe third was born deep within the dungeons of Rathir, a young Alfar girl named Eleanor Brea who grew to maturity blinded by the darkness that was her only home.\n\nUpon Eleanor Brea's ascendance to adulthood deep within the dark of Sydanus' prisons, the gifts of elemental magics came to her. In fury, the girl burned the dungeon to the ground.\n\nGuided by Master Torix and Bloodgood, she learned to wield her gift and, together, the three of them dared to fight against the tyrant queen.\n\nWord spread quickly of a new group of masters, mages, and artisans who would teach any willing to learn. In time, others courageous enough to challenge Sydanus' might came forward, and what had started with a resistance of three quickly became ten, then a hundred, then a thousand.\n\nTerrible battles of magic were waged. Thousands perished; entire cities were scoured from the face of the world, and untold horrors were birthed as each side tried desperately to craft the means of their victory.\n\nCiara Sydanus sought the destruction of their enemies by any method -- no sacrifice was to great, no atrocity too horrid. The darkest and the foulest of arts were pursued, and the cost to the populace was unrivaled by that of anyone's memory.\n\nBut the light of the three refused to be extinguished. The strength of Master Bloodgod, the wisdom and his skill, set the form and foundation of their hope. The brilliance of Master Torix, his knowledge and his insight, unlocked the chains of their bondage.

In the winters of the past they would chill the waters and the ocean to stillness. If one of the small fishing villages that dotted the coast, the fishermen shared a warning to those that made port: \"When the first snow falls, you must not go near the ocean.\" Wir, a young Ljosalfar who was reputed for his uneven temper and precociousness, would often ask the fishermen what the danger was. They would give no answer but to shake their heads and say. \"When the first snow falls, you must not go near the ocean.\"\n\nWir was never one of rules, and when the winter snows began to fall, and others dragged their boats on land, he continued fishing the sea. Every night, the older fishermen would beg him not to sail out the next morning and every morning that's just what Wir would do. The old fishermen were wrong, Wir thought, for nothing had bothered him but a bit of cold.\n\nEventually, a storm swept up one day that drove Wir under deck. When the winds and snow had finally died down, he emerged to find his vessel trapped in ice. For hours he sought to free his ship. But as night fell, a fog rolled in around his ship and a great voice cried, \"Another too small for me to keep! In a few years, you'll make a better catch!\" The winds swept up and Wir, terrified for his life ran under deck once more. Through the planks of his hull, he could hear the great ice sheets cracking, and he could feel the waves pushing his tiny ship. This carried on for hours, until he heard a tremendous crash! His ship had been pushed back by the frightful entity and its powerful storm, all the way back to his fishing village.\n\nEver since that day, Wir could not meet the faces of the older fishermen without acknowledging that they had been right.

He served as Amaldor to Eagonn for many years, and was a dependable and constant guardian of the High Commander. He was forever at Eagonn's side, ready to render his aid in every manner. His mind was keen, and his intellect unmatched. He was a skilled man-at-arms; as proficient with the instruments of war as any of the Firstsworn. He was a kind and gentle husband and father, and a generous Lord of the Almain Court. His patience was renowned throughout the kingdom, and his feats of strength famous to all. Despite this, Edorias was a good and humble knight. He dutifully followed Mitharu's path, and broke his fast with prayer each morn.\n\nEdorias was the son of Graphelm of Ederton and Slyvia Arcolm. He was much like his father in countenance, and bore the dignity of his mother in his noble composure.

You, like so many others before you, have assumed the monumental task of exploring the many facets of magic. This examination is normally given to initiates upon the first year of their studies. It is intended to serve as an introduction to our practices and methods concerning magic. The information contained within the Omnibus Arcana is sealed against unofficial usage, so rest assured that reading this will not result in your unofficial demise.\n\nIn the pages of this tome, you will embark upon an adventure of knowledge. Your quest is perhaps the greatest of all callings, the study of magic itself. The mages of our order have always been those ready to endure the rigors of research. This test will introduce the foundation of magical inquiry, a process which you will find integral to your studies during your time in the Scholia Arcana.\n\nNow, to begin this examination, you must go to the Rathir Chapterhouse courtyard. There, you will find a statue of a woman. Go and observe the statue.\n\nLesson I\n\nEleanor Brea was one of the founders of our order. Sorceress Brea was born some 800 years ago into a life of bondage. She was blind, and Ljosalfar far from Glen Suthain. She suffered under rule of the dictator Ciara Sydanus, yet she, like you, possessed a natural talent for magic. Eleanor Brea harnessed this gift to not only escape slavery, but to ultimately free Erathell of Sydanus' rule. She did this through discipline, through a determined commitment to learning the ways of the arcane. Eleanor Brea represents hope to our students.\n\nThe first lesson to learn from Eleanor is one for all of our order. Eleanor Brea was but one of the founders. Because she was the only one gifted with the use of magic, some consider her the true progenitor of the Scholia Arcana, but were it not for her allies, she would never have succeeded. The other statues in the courtyard represent the other two founders of the Scholia Arcana. Remember them well, for if it is your quest to become as great as Sorceress Brea herself, you will undoubtedly need the help of others.\n\nThe second lesson to learn from Eleanor Brea is at the heart of magical study. Eleanor Brea was among the first sorceress' to standardize the use of elements in her spell-casting. Before her, magic was a mysterious and imperfect practice. Even the ancient Order of Ash, one of the oldest societies of magic users in all of Amalur, were as wild and ungoverned then as we are orderly and precise today.\n\nThe third and final lesson to learn here is that of discipline. Eleanor Brea was not born a usurper. She did not become one of the most powerful mages in all of the Faelands in the course of a day. It did not happen accidentally, but through years and years of intense practice. If it is your wish to become similarly proficient, you must devote yourself to learning as she did. This will require hours of reading each day. It will involve dangerous and sometimes terrifying experiences. It will test your will and patience as no other obstacle can. And should you be able to continue this regimen, you will undoubtedly become as great as Eleanor Brea herself.\n\nIndeed, most applicants of the Scholia Arcana cannot face their potential; those that can rarely achieve it. Until now, none have been able to surpass their potential, but this may change with you.\n\nFor the next part of this lesson, you must go to the Rathir Bridge. Stand there and contemplate the bridge.\n\nLesson II\n\nIn the courtyard you learned the first three principles of method: unity, harmony, and discipline. These three tenants are at the foundation of every student's education as much as the bridge is at the foundation of Rathir. The bridge is a legacy of permanence and dedication. Originally, the Alfar who settled the Tywili Coast would take a skiff or rowboat to reach the spire rock. This was a treacherous voyage that ended with as many boats smashed upon the rocks as there were safely harbored. This bridge was built very early on in Rathir's construction through the combined effort of Dokkalfar settlers.\n\nThere are two lessons to be learned at the Rathir bridge. The first is an extenuation of the principle of unity, for here you can bear witness to what is possible when you work with others. The Rathir bridge is a symbol for the Dokkalfar people; one of perseverance and loyalty. The grandeur of Rathir is visible from afar, but once on the bridge you can truly see its magnificence. The construction of Rathir took many people working together in difficult conditions, and they were able to build one of the most elegant and elaborate cities known to Alfar. This is why the lesson of the Rathir bridge embodies the principle of proof. In all knowledge there is always proof of that knowledge. Look at the Rathir bridge and witness proof of Eleanor Brea's Unity.\n\nThe second lesson is the principle of duality. This bridge is an exit and an entrance, both to Rathir and to the Tywili Coast. You decide which, and in your decision, you illuminate the other aspect of this lesson, choice. Your studies at the Scholia Arcana will be exacting. Your teachers will be austere in their technique. At times you will feel as if you have no autonomy to pursue your own interests, but this bridge represents that dichotomy. In one direction lies a historic city of knowledge, beauty and the arts. In the other direction lies the Tywili Coast, a blood-soaked, war-torn battlefield that was once a stretch of idyllic farms and fishing villages. Both paths lead to exploring the greater world beyond the Rathir gates. You are singular amongst our order, in that you have the ability to determine your own Fate. Take full advantage of your unique freedom by recognizing duality in all things.\n\nWhen you are done meditating upon these lessons, proceed to the village of Mel Aglir, in Kandrian.\n\nLesson III\n\nMel Aglir sits at the heart of Kandrian, the land named after the family who has ruled for generations. The village is well defended from Tuatha raiders, bandits, and the wild Fae that roam the Plains of Erathell. There are many threats to Kandrian, and the kings and lords who rule here must always be ready for conflict.\n\nThe lesson to be learned in Mel Aglir is the principle of preparation. For centuries, Kandrian Keep has been a bastion of strength for the Alfar people Jocuri. The early Kings of Kandrian protected all of Erathell from the threats of Durek or Jottun invasion. Kandrian Keep was the only fortress to withstand Ciara Sydanus' might. In times of crisis, the Kings of Kandrian would house the villagers within the walls of the keep. A Kandrian guard as well as a militia kept the peace throughout the villages and countryside. The people of Kandrian were always prepared, and thus able to survive.\n\nThe survival of Mel Aglir is a testament to the importance of preparation. Whereas the previous lessons facilitate success in the Scholia Arcana, this lesson will help you survive. Students of the Scholia Arcana are frequently and woefully unprepared to deal with magic. It is a volatile and hazardous force, and there is no room for imprudent experimentation in our order. Those who do not heed this lesson are liable to suffer, and unwittingly cause others to harm. Mel Aglir stands as a warning to any who would delve into the secrets of magic. Prepare appropriately, or suffer the consequences.\n\nWhen you are ready, proceed to the Kandrian countryside.\n\nFinal Lesson\n\nYou have arrived at the final lesson forming the foundation of magical inquiry. Of everything that you will learn at Scholia Arcana, the most valuable lesson will be the principle of observation. The mastery of the elements, or the ability to invoke powerful sorcery is useless without an understanding of one's surroundings. An environment is a complex system of interrelated attributes, and in order to function within one, you must be aware of the boundaries and rules of the system. Many of our order become myopic, closeted academicians, too concerned with their own learning to apply it to the world. Others haphazardly conduct their research in the hostile and unpredictable world. Both of these avenues end in a failure to face your potential, or to successfully achieve it.\n\nAll of the previous principles are useless without observation. Learn to regard your surrounding in many ways as possible. Explore, and consider the people around you. Mel Aglir is an example of preparation, but it also a lesson in observation. The village has dwindled since the beginning of the war. The young were enlisted, and many others moved to safer locales. The once serene farmland of Kandrian is now rife with bandits and monsters because Lord Kandrian hides in his keep like so many of our reclusive sages.\n\nSimilarly, the principle of duality inheres in observation. You have the freedom to control your Fate and your every decision is informed by your surroundings. Lord Kandrian refuses to fight the Tuatha, and he cannot make a wise judgement from behind stone walls. The battle you just faced is a direct result of Lord Kandrian's poor understanding of the principle of duality, because of ignorance of the existing conditions.\n\nObservation is the main tool with which we discover proof. It requires discipline in order to be effective. You may not be the most dutiful student of the principle of observation, but if you hadn't been prepared for that battle, you would have perished. In order to be prepared, you must first have immersed yourself into your surroundings, and become aware of the dangers posed in this land.\n\nTo conclude this examination, return to Savant Idris Theonen.

It balances the humors in the same fashion as Mitharu's order equilibrates the disarray of this mortal life, strengthening the sick of body, and calming the wounded spirit.\n\nYet many tragedies await the miserable wretches who expel temperance from conviviality, think excess in drinking to be the happiest life; for their life is nothing but disorientation, debauchery, nakedness, spewing, idleness, Hexes, and more drink. You may see such sluggards, half-naked, staggering, wearing horse bridles about their necks like the fineries of kings, vomiting on one another in the name of fellowship; and others, flush with the rose of their drunkenness, filthy, faces like the pale, bulbous countenance of fish, livid, and still seeking another flagon of ale to last them till the sunrise.

As with all blessings in keeping with the Authority's order, drink should be partaken of with the utmost temperance and moderation, to maintain one's health, one's good standing, and most importantly, one's faith. I therefore advise those who have undertaken an ascetic life, and who are fond of water, the sweet juice of temperance, to turn their backs on consumption for the sake of intoxication, shunning the allure of the bottle, and instead quenching their thirst with the divine drink of wisdom.\n\nIt is proper, therefore, that young men avoid the flickering tongue of the chaos drink. For it is not right to pour into the flaming cauldron of humanity the fieriest of all liquids - wine -- adding, as it were, fire to fire. The crackling blaze will ignite the youthful impulses of man's worst desires. Beware the lusts of the flesh and the hot touch of fornication.

However, the task is not to be taken lightly. One wayward pinch of Cripplespore is enough to leave even the heartiest Jottun weak for days. For this reason, I am writing this book; so that future alchemists, apothecaries, healers and herbalists succeed in practicing this dangerous and mysterious art.\n\nWhereas a complete and exhaustive list of recipes and reagents may be of interest to the novice, I instead will provide a more valuable knowledge: the manner in which the potions, elixirs, tonics, restoratives, physics and all other alchemical products are constructed. At first, this may seem elementary; the information can be divined by even the most inexperienced alchemist. However, there is a great lack of understanding by most practitioners of Alchemy at what exactly occurs during the process of creating a vial of magical liquid. Here, in abbreviated form, is that process.\n\nFirst, the alchemist needs the proper tools, and the most vital of these can be found in the alchemy workbench. This space, and the accompanying equipment, is necessary for even the most minor of alchemical procedures. Fortunately, workbenches can be found throughout Amalur in almost every town and village.\n\nSecondly, and just as crucial, the alchemist needs the reagents themselves. Reagent gathering is a skill and craft unto itself, and many a brave soul has focused on nothing but the harvesting of alchemical reagents from the plants of the Faelands. The variety of these plants can be found in the Cradle of Summer in the Plains of Erathell, however, the diverse flora of Dalentarth often yields a bountiful variety, and the deserts of Detyre can hide a cornucopia of minerals and flowers.\n\nThere are a great number of reagents, indeed, too many to list here. However, one commonly accepted principle is that every reagent worth harvesting carries within itself a prime essence. Take, for example, the Sativa Stalk. This tough, ubiquitous weed can be found throughout the Faelands, in the most extreme climates and conditions. It is required in many potions that involve affecting the corporeal aspects of the imbiber, and clearly is imbued with an essence of a physical nature. It is easily surmised that the harvested fibers of this weed possess an essence relating to the physical world.\n\nFinally, the alchemist must possess the unique recipe, and appropriate experience required to handle the delicate and intricate nature of combining reagents. There are countless methods for mixing potions: boiling, mashing, calcination, sublimation, smoking, distillation, dilution, absorption, adsorption, ceration, chromatography, congelation and so forth. The brave may even experiment without a recipe, however it is a dangerous risk and is strongly discouraged except in cases of emergency.\n\nWhile this is by no means, the entire body of knowledge of alchemical method, it is a solid foundation. Armed with this knowledge, you are now able to perform rudimentary alchemy. Only through your own dedication will you progress in this field.

This is not so, and betrays an unfortunate gnomish superiority that mars much of our scholarship concerning the lower races.\n\nIn fact, the goblin schism occurred a few years prior to the Crymbil arrival in Marthen Row, the result of dedades - perhaps centuries - old cultural divergence within the race. Though it cannot be disputed that the Crymbil owe most, if not all, their grasp of the scientific method, literacy, and history to their time in Marthen Row, it was the development of a greater intelligence and civility that had led them to split from their more brutish cousins.\n\nAs for the gnomes of Marthen Row, this act of charity was to be their unmaking. It took the less civilized Skratta several decades to find what became of the departed Crymbil, but track them down they did.

The Crymbil, however, were able to escape in nearly full numbers, taking with them all they'd learned from our gnomish forebears along with, it is believed, a few gnomish relics of great historical value.\n\nThe Crymbil then fled to Thousand Eye Gorge, a dank and unwelcoming swamp, where they founded Marthenshire and lay the foundations for a new realm. There they fostered the skills learned from their benefactors and evolved into the exacting, inquisitive, and (dare I say) learned race we know them to be today.\n\nDespite their race's flowering in Martenshire, the threat of a new Skratta invasion looms large in the Crymbil mind, though it is widely known that the Skratta have since occupied themselves with other pursuits.", "authors": ["Unknown  "]}, {"id": 13845, "title": "Motus Mining (Days 1-24)", "text": "Accident Report\n\nIt happened last night, before the evening meal and before the briefing by the Scholars Jolienne and Imas.

Sometimes a box is just a box, and precious magic is better saved for the monster in the darkness.

Not wishing to repeat the mistake of the box, Peregrine decided to simply walk into the cave. He was thrown back with great violence, landing several yards away and coughing blood.\n\n\"Foolish boy! I bring you to a warded cave and you stroll into it without even the slightest use of magic. It is as if you grow worse with time rather than better. Now, let's remove whatever curse your haste has given you.\"\n\nIn his third week, Peregrine began to despair of ever becoming a mage, but was obliged to accompany Torin to a nearby healer's cottage. Torin retired to the Master Healer's chambers and Peregrine was left alone with one of her assistants. The assistant was quite beautiful and would smile warmly at Peregrine whenever he dared look upon her. She approached the young apprentice, touched him gently, and slowly brought her face to his as if to deliver a kiss. Peregrine, as bashful as he was young, flushed and fled the healer's cottage.\n\nAfter a few hours, the young man began to wonder after his master. When he made to return to the cottage, he found the door warded. For this he was prepared and he dispelled it with ease. \"If only Master Frostbreaker could have seen that,\" he thought.\n\nHe was less prepared for what lay beyond the door: his master, naked and magically chained to the wall, the healer and her assistant, naked as well and asleep at his feet.\n\n\"Come, help me boy!\" barked Torin. \"These are not healers at all, but witches. They poisoned me and cast wards to bind me to this wall. As I can tolerate most poisons, I remained alert enough to cast a sleep spell upon them. Now, free me!\"\n\nThese wards were of a more difficult sort, but Peregrine was able to dispel them as well. His master was pleased.\n\n\"Master? How did the witches manage to poison you?\"\n\n\"Suffice to say, a 'healer's kiss' is likely not what you'd think it to be. We shall never speak of this again.\" Peregrine was too embarrassed to respond and preceded his master out of the cottage.\n\nTorin eyed his apprentice warily, mistaking the boy's bashfulness for cunning. \"I suppose you have passed enough tests.

A Varani shaper, he came to Erathell from far to the North, searching the world for the knowledge of stone. After refusing to build a temple in Sydanus' name, he was cast into prison.\n\nThe second was a Gnome named Marus Torix. A gifted gnosicant, he had long ago left the safety and comfort of his libraries to travel the world, to learn of things with his own eyes. For teaching a doctrine different from the unquestioning worship of Sydanus and her regime, he, too, was cast into prison.\n\nThe third was born deep within the dungeons of Rathir, a young Alfar girl named Eleanor Brea who grew to maturity blinded by the darkness that was her only home.\n\nUpon Eleanor Brea's ascendance to adulthood deep within the dark of Sydanus' prisons, the gifts of elemental magics came to her. In fury, the girl burned the dungeon to the ground.\n\nGuided by Master Torix and Bloodgood, she learned to wield her gift and, together, the three of them dared to fight against the tyrant queen.\n\nWord spread quickly of a new group of masters, mages, and artisans who would teach any willing to learn. In time, others courageous enough to challenge Sydanus' might came forward, and what had started with a resistance of three quickly became ten, then a hundred, then a thousand.\n\nTerrible battles of magic were waged. Thousands perished; entire cities were scoured from the face of the world, and untold horrors were birthed as each side tried desperately to craft the means of their victory.\n\nCiara Sydanus sought the destruction of their enemies by any method -- no sacrifice was to great, no atrocity too horrid. The darkest and the foulest of arts were pursued, and the cost to the populace was unrivaled by that of anyone's memory.\n\nBut the light of the three refused to be extinguished. The strength of Master Bloodgood, the wisdom and his skill, set the form and foundation of their hope. The brilliance of Master Torix, his knowledge and his insight, unlocked the chains of their bondage. And the passion of Mistress Brea, her spirit and her fury, lit the way to freedom.\n\nWhat none could do alone, these three achieved together. Seven years after earning their freedom, high upon the heights of the spire of Rathir, they battled Sydanus, and the Dark Empyrean was imprisoned. Too powerful to be destroyed, she was contained beneath what would become the grounds of the Scholia Arcana, sealed away by the arcane glyphs and runes of our three founders. Here she will remain and you, Archsage, are the only sentinel of her prison. For on this foundation was the order built: to reach the greatest extents of knowledge, lest the reign of the Dark Empyrean returns again. Guard this wisdom, and find a worthy successor.\n\nDifferent paths had led each into the chains of slavery.

Under his banner the humans of the Alfar lands created a civilization and rose to prominence roughly around 177 BA (Before Arcana). The nation is centered around Port Myria and the lands south and west of Dalentarth. For a complete history, read The Rise of the Almain by Zeriah Carreten.\n\nAlmain Appearance\n\nThe Almain people vary biologically more than any other people of the Faelands, ranging from darker skinned than Dokkalfar, to as pale as Varani, and from dearly Gnome height to nearly as tall as Jottun. The majority of Almain in the Faelands emigrated from Port Myria and are typically of a bronze-colored complexion, with brown hair and eyes. As immigrants, Almain clothing is usually of a simple nature, favoring basic colors and little adornment. However, ceremonial and religious garb can be as ornate as that of the Alfar. Clothing is usually made from leather, furs, and fabrics such as cotton or wool.\n\nAlmain Society\n\nAlmain society is structured on order and a rigid work ethic. Codes and doctrines of regularized life can be found everywhere in Almain homelands, and settlers are no exception. The Almain people worship Mitharu more often than other deities, and laws are usually based on the teachings of the Voice of Three, Saints Odwig, Eadric, and Hadwin. Almain traditionally followed a feudal system under King Almere's rule, and continue to do so with dogmatic distinction between the nobles and commoners. Although there are many Almain merchants, they are not as entrepreneurial as the Varani, and serve as local suppliers more than as a class unto themselves. The Almain are considered a humble people by the Varani, and xenophobic and small-minded by the Alfar.

Upon further study however, we found that the trees were rotten and the stone unbreakable. The mission's sorcerer found the root cause to be a cursed magic. We traced it back to the sources, an Erathi altar on top of the mountain, but we were unable to open the door.\n\nThe locals were of no help. Most of the mhave banded together and settled the southern coast, but they all seem to be trapped into some kind of religious zealotry, worshipping a god by the name of Akara.

Not only had the Dverga settled here at one point, but many of their ships have washed ashore. The salvage should at least pay for this expedition, but it's not worth another trip back to collect the rest.\n\nWe found a large harbour on the west side of the island, of Dvergan construction.

It is also resistant to corrosion, polishes to a mirror shine, and never tarnishes, making it desirable for nautical uses.\n\nThe first Dverga to settle on Obsidian Isle marveled at seasteel and learned to craft weapons and other tools from it.

While it is generally assumed that creatures such as boggarts rely on magic to exist, they are not commented on in this discussion).\n\nBarghests\n\nThe bipedal predator that stalks the plains and caverns of this world, the barghest seems capable of providing for itself on the merit of its claws and fangs alone.

Much like a serpent brings to bear poison in its fangs, so too do barghests strike with frost magic in their maws. It is a beneficial magic, to be sure - doubtless meant to slow their prey down - but one would never know it by looking at the fur of the beast.

It is both a weapon and a tool, a source of fascination to all people. Who can help but be mesmerized by the intricacies within a dancing flame? From this single element sparks the spirit of life. For ages, few have understood its potential, and fewer still have mastered the art of controlling tis starved nature. Yet there is a place in the Faelands, where it is not only studied, but worshipped; for within Aodh, there exists an especial connection to this otherworldly power. Indisputably, Aodh is the prime nexus of the living flame.\n\nIn this volume, I will give a brief history of the legendary sanctum and elucidate the mystery surrounding this ruin.\n\nPart 1 - The Mythos\n\nThe beginnings of Aodh are shrouded by the darkness of ages past. According to legend, the temple was a place of communion with Vraekor, the God of Fire. Before the coming of the Architect, the Sidhe was a panoply of disparate elemental energies. When the Architect first came upon the Sidhe, he was nearly consumed by a magical, wild inferno. He sought to quell the raging fire, and diverted the waters of the Sidhe so that they would fall upon the inferno. With the flames extinguished, he could see the inferno was actually a sanctum of fire. The tale ends with the Architect then turning to shape the rest of the SIdhe.\n\nThe earliest recorded mention of Aodh comes from the histories of the Durek-Alfar War. According to the Dokkalfar historian Ormend, during the Durek invasion of Alfar lands, a portion of the Durek army came across a \"glowing temple carved from stone at the foot of a waterfall.\" The Durek contingent, being a \"warlike and foolhardy tribe\" entered and disappeared within the depths of the temple. It is possible that the glowing temple in question was any number of ruins found throughout Dalentarth, however, earlier, when writing of the Durek army's route, Ormend describes their trespassing of a sacred Fae place: \"an enormous tree, unlike any others found within the enchanted Fae forest.\" This would be Caer Nyralim of the Ring of Keozai, found in the Sidhe, and well within half a league of Aodh.\n\nThe next possible mention of Aodh is found in Fae lore, through a verse in the Withering War:\n\n\"... and Ysa planted the Gardens after the Storm, and Nurtured the Court of Summer by the Ruins of Fire.\"\n\nHere we find a reference to \"the Ruins of Fire\" near Ysa and the Court of Summer. When taken figuratively, it is an obvious reference to the lands destroyed during the Withering War, however, if a literal interpretation is made, then this must be a direct reference to Aodh. The only other eligible \"ruins\" near Ysa are either lost to us completely, or Arduath and Rundamir. Both Arduath and Rundamir are more distinctly hollows of Fae design, rather than a set of ruins. Neither have any connection with fire, nor any known history of being burned during the events of the Withering War. Therefore, this phrase must be in reference to Aodh.\n\nAewald, in her works on the Withering War, explains that it occurred shortly after the Order of Ash established the universal principles of magic. Already, then, is Aodh known as a ruin, rather than intact. This further supports the theory that Aodh is centuries older than most ruins found within Dalentarth proper. Given that Ormend specifically describes Aodh as a temple, rather than a ruin, we can surmise the timeline for Aodh's ruination to be sometime between the Durek-Alfar War and the formation of the Almain kingdom some 1100 years later.", "authors": ["Valfillian Carr"]}, {"id": 13868, "title": "Tyr's Journal IV", "text": "Journal of Tyr Magnus\n\nI've sold Hroth Magnus' breastplate to Thora Woolstring, who will undoubtedly re-sell it for some degree of profit.

However, even as Mitharu's natural order sometimes suffers from aberration, so too did the way of the fae once fall into disorder and chaos. This was the Withering War.\n\nThe Withering War (God-Storm) was a fierce battle, one fought primarily between two men, two very extraordinary heroes: Ysa, of the Court of Summer, and Ohn, his rival, of the easterly Court of Winter. Enemies for ages, Ysa and Ohn has let their bitterness get the best of them, a very mortal perception that was no doubt a result of recent incursions into the faelands by alfar, Varani, and Almain. Many scholars contend that the rise of the young races in the west corresponds directly to a rise in fae violence, madness, and decay, but such theories cannot be proven due to the elusiveness of the subject.\n\nWhatever their reasons, Ysa and Ohn were committed to their folly, and breaking from the Great Cycle they waged war on each other. This conflict left many fae warriors dead and many others questioning their role in the world, for the concept of the fae Telling purports that all fates are determined and all fae roles - or archetypes - are dictated by the natural order. The Withering War went against every expectation, and the fae are not known for their ability to adapt to change.\n\nFollowing the battle, the victorious Ysa severed all ties with the Court of Winter, declaring a new kingdom in western Alfaria, a \"civilized\" empire to be known as the Great Kingdom of Summer. As his first act, the newly crowned High King established the great Houses of Ballads, Seasons, and Valor, institutions meant to create a fae identity that was unique to the Court of Summer and its subjects. Not longer would the Telling be shared between the forces of spring and autumn. The balance had shifted.\n\nFilled with pride, Ysa set about creating a city that his counterparts in the Court of Winter would forever envy. For the site of his grand city he chose his own hollow, which sat atop a potent wellspring of fae energy known as the Font, believed by many scholars to be the source of the Court of Summer's magic. Gifted shapers from across the western faelands arrived to aid their new ruler in his quest. Together they fashioned a city inspired by the grasping towers and vaulted halls of mortal fortresses, and borne from the gardens where Ysa first discovered his role in the Telling.\n\nWhen Ysa died and the his energy entered the Great Cycle, the sitting High Court named the city after him as a testament to his revolutionary lifetime.

It goes without saying that the founding members, Elodan Bloodgood, Marus Torix, and Eleanor Brea are among this number, but there are yet others who, in their own way, have heralded themselves into the annals of legend.\n\nWhere better to start than with Evren the Burnheart? During the early years of the order, our ranks were dominated by the Alfar, whose affinities for magic seemed limitless. Very rarely did we have humans -- save, of course, the founding members -- who had the magical capacity to withstand the rigors of initiation. When Evren -- a small, almost sickly Almain appeared in Rathir, it seemed the only way he would have gained admission into Scholia was by pity of his examiners.\n\nNot so, it was found, for within minutes of his arrival, he demonstrated for us an application of fire magic that had never been witnessed before. It was almost as if he pulled a star from the sky, and slammed it into the earth with meteoric force. The plants and soil that had once been there had been turned to glass and cinders under such heat. In time we learned that, though powerful, his skills were nearly uncontrollable, for they were innate. Eventually, we learned from his powers a new, more potent form of fire magic than was previously thought possible, and taught Evren the serenity needed to quell the raging fires within him.\n\nThen there was the Siren. A Traveler with no name and no stories of her past save for a knowing smile. That the order discovered her existence is a miracle in and of itself -- allegedly, she was utilizing her comeliness in a less-than savory manner in a small village in the Icebrine. By chance, she met an initiate of our order who (in what must have been a sudden burst of uncharacteristic indiscretion) accepted her proposal. A small song from her lips, and he realized she was using some form of magic to charm him into thinking she had earned her coin. It took some convincing, but she agreed to some sessions of tutelage with the Scholia. But to this day, we still cannot truly fathom the sing-song spells she wove with her voice....\n\nBut the Scholia is remembered for its... more peculiar members as well. Fruntbert the Miasmic was touted as a powerful mage long before he came to our order, though, none could say why. He submitted himself to the Trial of Initiation, and though he passed with some success, there was much confusion as to whether his reputation was deserved. When asked, he affirmed that it was, and offered to prove it - by engaging at flatulence so powerful as to propel him from Pryderi all the way to the Scholia Arcana Courtyard!

Listen now, for I will tell a tale of tears and woe; the tale of Dwynian, a gleaming star, who shone as only stars could shine - and fell as only they could fall.\n\nIt was the end of the first age of Rathir, when Anathon ruled from spiretop, and all harkened to his word. Among the fisher-folk below was born a babe, whom they named Dwynian - named after the lace of white that caps the water's waves. At five days she showed the spark of magic; and at five years her powers were so great that she was brought among the pupils who sat at Anathon's feet. Ten years she studied the wisdom of Lyria's gift, there, and from Anathon himself gained mastery of the art. At fifteen years of age no mage atop the spire was alf as cunning, wise, or strong as Dwynian. No girl in Rathir was half as fair.\n\nOne day as Dwynian went down the stairs that wind around our Spire, she spied the guards assembled down below. Their helms and swords sparkled in the sun. Once hundred of them stood there. One hundred soldiers bold and proud. But let us speak plainly, for all there could have been a thousand, Dwynian saw only one- His name was Ranu and he was lovely to behold.\n\nThat night a sweet, sad song drifted from the Spiretop. And though he did not know it, the song was meant for him - for Ranu - as he paced upon the battlements below. When he retired from his post, he found flowers upon his door. Nor were the flowers cut pinned. The door itself had come to life and green stalks sprouted from its frame. In the morning when he rose, a songbird from some exotic land perched in his window. It sang to him the sweetest song and showed no fear him at all. When he passed a fountain pool, in its depth he saw two haunting eyes. Beautiful eyes. Eyes he had seen somewhere before. And so it went for four days, with flowers, and birds, and other signs. On the fifth day, in the reflection of his sword, he spied her - spied Dwynian - standing far behind him, watching him with eyes that could pierce stone. Eyes he knew. On the fifth day, Ranu climbed the spire and found her at its top. \"It is you\" he said. \"Yes, she said, it is I.\" And she knew the love that had struck her heart had smitten his as well.\n\nOn the eve of the fifth day, Ailoc came. He was a whisper on the wind, a darkness on the waves, a chill over the golden plains. He blackened the cops and tore the farmers limb from limb, feasting on their bones. Then he stood outside of Rathir, raged upon the bluffs of Tywil, and dared Anathon to come forth and face him. When everyone saw that he'd done, and heard Ailoc's raging words, the guards were summoned to the gates. Every last guard was called and Ranu was among them. As he stood in all his armor he looked back and saw Dwynian, watching him with her gaze.\n\nOne hundred guards and more marched out of Rathir. But for every guard, Ailoc called thresh, boggart, and leanashe to his command. One hundred guards and more marched out of Rathir. None returned.\n\nWhen everyone saw what he had done, a silence fell over Rathir. A grave look fell over Anathon's face, but he spoke no words. At last, Dwynian stood up before them. She wore robes of white, and her hair was plaited in intricate braids. 'I have mastered all the arts of magic,' she said. 'I am strong and swift and I do not know fear. If I cannot stop this scourge, who can?' Awed, no one spoke against her. Anathon's eyes clouded with sadness, then, without a word, he nodded.\n\nDwynian crossed the bridge and left the gates of Rathir. She strode across the blackened field and then the field of bones. She found her Ranu where he lay dying. She bent and kissed him long and sweet, but once. Then she rose and made her way toward Alioc.\n\nHis boggarts she burnt with a flick of her wrist, and his thresh she split in half with bolts of lightning. The leanashe she struck with ice and tore with knots of wind. And then she came to Ailoc. From Rathir, it was said, their fight appeared like a summer storm, with dark clouds and bright forks of lightning and growling thunderous booms. At last, it is said, she called upon the bones of the earth itself, and they sprang from the ground and cut through Ailoc like a dozen sharpened spears. When Dwynian stepped close to see that he was dead. Ailoc raised his head and freed his arm. He broke the tip from one of the spikes and hurled it at her chest. The effort tore against the spikes and cut the last of life from him. He fell motionless and dead, and never saw the spike he threw hit home, landing fatally in Dwynian's breast.\n\nTwice was Dwynian struck in the heart. Once by love and once by hatred. From deadly heatred she crawled now, with the last of life still in her. She crawled until she reached her love, her Ranu. She kissed him one more time, wrapped her arms around him lay down her head, and died.", "authors": ["Unknown  "]}, {"id": 13895, "title": "The Barelegs Sisters", "text": "A tale of the bewitching Barelegs Sisters.\n\nThe Barelegs Sisters\n\nFor a time, every man of Emberdeep was rapturously in love with one of the \"Barelegs Sisters\": Astrid, Thora, and Helga. It was hard to argue - and many a dwarft lost life or limb trying - which of the three was the most beautiful and enchanting.\n\nThe place whence they came is not known, but it is generally believed that they ran away from home when very young. One can only speculate on the reason and whether they left by their own choice or by consequence of their beguiling effect (even as very young ladies). They thence moved from place to place, never staying long before wearing out their welcome or fleeing from a frothing manly mob and an enraged womanly populace.\n\nTheir time amongst the men of Emberdeep began when they were found floating aboard a raft by a Dverga ship. They were not, it is told, on board but a few minutes before their presence triggered something of a donnybrook. Such a ruckus would not be unexpected on a ship full of men long at sea, but this row was without equal. So irresistible were the sisters's beauty and - to the diminutive Dverga - their novel tallness, that the crew took complete leave of their wits.\n\nAfter a few days, the ship returned unexpectedly to Emberdeep whereupon the sisters were ordered ashore. Before the captain confined them to quarters (specifically, the captain's own quarters) he gave them a choice: \"go ashore or off the plank.\" The sisters, who'd grown bored of their time at sea, gladly obliged.\n\nIn Emberdeep, the sisters caused a stir unmatched even by their previous exploits. Their towering height and preference for shortened dresses offered even the tallest man of Emberdeep an irresistible and heretofore unimagined view of their beauty. And the shorter men amongst them described an even more breathtaking vista.\n\nNot only were the sisters beautiful and exotic, but each was capable of driving a man mad in her own way: Astrid for her blond hair and long legs, Thora for her sweet voice and laugh, and Helga for her way with a sword. The last is curious as it was fact often repeated of the youngest sister, but no one could ever recall seeing her handle a blade.\n\nBut, their stay was to be predictably brief. Beautiful women always inflame jealousy in both men and women, and the Barelegs Sisters were no exception. Once they began appearing in bedrooms all over the Obsidian Isle, the women of the great dwarven houses howled for their expulsion. But the Council - its members, to a man, smitten with the sisters - refused.\n\nSo it was, until all three sisters were discovered in the bedchambers of a Rathiri envoy. The envoy himself managed to flee, but the sisters were not so fortunate. A quickly staged trial found them giulty of disquieting of the peace and other moral outrages and sentenced them cast into the sea. Their pleas for mercy fell on deaf ears as each surrendered their breath to the deep.\n\nTo this day, Dvergan men take to the seas in secret hope of finding the sisters alive, well, and waiting aboard a flimsy raft, and those back home pine for the Barelegs Sisters return, even if for only one night.", "authors": ["Unknown  "]}, {"id": 13896, "title": "Til's Collection II", "text": "My Grandmother's Pearl\n\nIt was a fantasy, but satisfying nonetheless.

Under Varlaine he bravely fought. The conditions were grueling. Five days they marched east, then five days south, then five north again. Though he thought of slaying the foe night and day, battle came upon him like a swift and deadly blow. The field was empty, and then it was full of Tuatha, charging, screaming, waving swords. His side charged as well. Nil saw good men cut down. Some slayed one, or a dozen foes. Some cried and soiled themselves and died like dogs. When the battle was done, Nil stood yet. Nil stood and looked upon the carrion of the day. War is an evil thing, he thought, yet fight we must.\n\nHe washed his cape, brown with earth and red with blood, in the stream and girded himself for war.

A Varani shaper, he came to Erathell from far to the north, searching the world for the knowledge of stone. After refusing to build a temple in Sydanus' name, he was cast into prison.\n\nThe second was a Gnome named Marus Torix. A gifted gnosticant, he had long ago left the safety and comfort of his libraries to travel the world, to learn of things with his own eyes. For teaching a doctrine different from the unquestioning worship of Sydanus and her regime, he, too, was cast into prison.\n\nThe third was born deep within the dungeons of Rathir, a young Alfar girl named Eleanor Brea who grew to maturity blinded by the darkness that was her only home.\n\nUpon Eleanor Brea's ascendance to adulthood deep within the dark Sydanus' prisons, the gifts of elemental magics came to her. In fury, the girl burned the dungeon to the ground.\n\nGuided by Masters Torix and Bloodgood, she learned to wield her gift and, together, the three of them dared to fight against the tyrant queen.\n\nWord spread quickly of a new group of masters, mages, and artisans who would teach any willing to learn. In time, others courageous enough to challenge Sydanus' might came forward, and what had started with a resistance of three quickly became ten, then a hundred, then a thousand.\n\nTerrible battles of magic were waged. Thousands perished; entire cities were scoured from the face of the world, and untold horrors were birthed as each side tried desperately to craft the means of their victory.\n\nClara Sydanus sought the destruction of their enemies by any method -- no sacrifice was too great, no atrocity too horrid.

Should one be astute of mind and resilient in the face of adversity, one can overcome the hazards involved when achieving the potential of the Cripplespore Cap.\n\nLet us begin by examining, what, exactly, is the Cripplespore Cap. The Cripplespore Cap is a type of fungus found at the base of large trees. It is unique in that, when left to grow undisturbed, it will reach at least eye level. It exudes a faint metallic odor and is yellowish-brown in color. The conical fruit body is narrow and darkens near the stalk. The entire body also glows with a soft luminescence.\n\nBut do the physical characteristics of the Cripplespore Cap capture the entirety of what it is? The poisonous nature of the Cripplespores have been well-documented in the Overview of Mycological Study by my sister and fellow Scholar, Aura Hanri. Besides the toxins found in the mushroom's biology, the magical essence of the Cripplespore is firmly in the Poison sphere. This makes the harmless looking Cripplespore a formidable alchemy ingredient.\n\nHow do we go about investigating this essence? The true potency and uses of this mushroom are only exposed when we probe beneath the surface. There is much more that can be observed by simple field research.

By what logic was I, an alchemical botanist, be charged with compiling a written record of the indigenous peoples of this land? Surely the Basilica's needs could better have been served by a cultural historian, an anatomist, or even a taxonomist. Little did I know what the insistence of the Basilica stemmed from the fact that, indeed, a representative from each of these disciplines had been previously assigned the task of assembling the tome you now hold in your hands. And, through no fault of their own, each of them failed in their own way.\n\nWhat is a Fae? If we cannot satisfy even this most base of questions, then the following pages can contribute nothing to the corpus of gnomish knowledge. We know that Fae are a sentient race that dwells in the forests Dalentarth, and those of Klurikon. We also know that they seem to be divided into two \"tribes,\" for lack of a better term, that are somehow aligned or otherwise attuned to the seasons of summer and winter. Though Fae appear in distinct genders, these are apparently superficial (perhaps, even elective) differences, and have no impact on their reproduction or social responsibility. We also know that the Fae are not mortal - they are subject to some form of reincarnation, returning to life at some point after they die. In addition, Fae are intensely magical beings more so than any other race encounter thus far by the gnomes.\n\nBut there is more. We also know that there are creatures referred to as \"wild Fae\" - boggarts, sprites and others - which are somehow also related to the Summer and Winter Fae. There are rumors that, at the time I am writing this introduction, that a new \"tribe\" of Fae has appeared in Alabastra, and are far more militant than either the Summer or Winter Fae have ever demonstrated themselves to be.\n\nIf anything, these additional facts can answer our initial questions, at least in part. A Fae is a magical being, whose essence is as mutable as the whole of nature. Just as both the red rocks of Detyre and the steppes of the Plains of Erathell are both part of one land, so too are many different creatures part of the one collective that we refer to as \"Fae.\"\n\nPhysiologically, not much is known about the Fae, even after years of study. I do know that Fae anatomy though it bears some semblance to our own, is perhaps more similar to that of a plant (which, I presume, is why the Basilica eventually concluded a botanist would be more useful to conduct such a study). How and why such anatomical features were combined remains a mystery (indeed, almost everything about the Fae remains a mystery), but I can only imagine that magic plays a strong role in their bodily functions.\n\nSocially, the Fae are bedviling. They are as capable of living alone in the wild, no better than a common beast, as they are of complex social interaction. Rumors persist that the Fae have a city, or something like it, hidden in the primordial forests of Dalentarth, though few have ever seen it. From what reports I can verify, it seems that the Summer Fae have some authoritative body which goes by the name of the Court of Summer. This is apparently ruled over by a High King. But they pay no taxes or tithes, swear no fealties nor fight in wars. For what purpose, then, does this centralization of power exist? \nLike so many things, a Fae will only tell you that it exists because it does, and that it always has. Could such an institution really be so eternal? Could such titles and rituals really have meaning without substance? It seems more likely that the Fae are playing at having a society than actually having one.\n\nWe can say with some certainty that the Fae are an old race, older than many others by far. In rare cases where we can find datable Erathi and Fae ruins, we can successfully establish that both originated around the same time. This can be difficult to prove, since Fae tend to construct with plant matter - which has a habit of decaying - but though the evidence is circumstantial, it is enough to conclude that the Fae are perhaps the oldest living things in Amalur. But seeking to learn about the course of that history is about as satisfying as interviewing a tree on the accomplishments of its life - for though a Fae might live a hundred years, it does so frozen in place. When asked, a Fae might answer with some uncertainty about the events that transpired. In truth those hundred years are to a Fae a series of repetitions, of cycles that have repeated since time began and will repeat until time ends.\n\nAs this book will show, a Fae will tell you that everything repeats. And though empirical evidence proves otherwise, they are partly right - for a Fae, nothing ever changes.", "authors": ["Nemius Perigums"]}, {"id": 13917, "title": "On Embereyes", "text": "On the Medicinal Properties of Embereyes by Alanter Renalus.\n\n1. Abstract\n\nThe essence of Eludus Senelos, known as Embereyes, is clearly of the Earth sphere. The plant is most commonly found among the ferns and tall grasses of Allestar Glade, although it can grow in caves or at the base of trees. A typical specimen will be of waist height and is brighter in color than the closely related Sweetrose. Of Embereyes, it can be surveyed that many do not react to the mixture of Frost elements that can often reduce herbs of this nature to a more potable constitution. In order to extract the essence of Embereyes, the plant must first be mashed into a thick pulp. Extracting the nature of said herb is a matter of combination with other similarly potent varieties of flora. These methods are carefully detailed in the works of Oleander Sinclair, Alchemist, as well as Scholars Nanne Hanri and Aura Hanri.\n\nWhat, however, is the remedial property with which this herb can affect such a beneficial change to its imbibers? As I have previously suggested, the elemental nature of the family of plants found natively in the region of Allestar Glade and Odarath does not predict the quality of confluence with other bodies of the same elemental sphere. Similarly, method does not control the consistency of the essence. This is both useful and dangerous, as new formulae for its employment must carefully consider the outcome of negatively corresponding components. In such cases, it may just as likely produce a debilitating poison as a helpful tonic.\n\nWhat derivatives of this herb, then, can be attributed to the elemental nature? Earth, being the most constant and dependable of elemental spheres cannot be the primary cause of this instability. In the following paper, I will argue that there is something more fundamental to the nature of Embereyes that determines its alchemical potential. Ultimately, I will propose a new theory for the medicinal properties of Embereyes, namely, that another agent is determining the volatility of resultant mixtures.", "authors": ["Alanter Renalus"]}, {"id": 13918, "title": "On Gemstones", "text": "By Brother Gamian of St. Hadwyn's Undying Mission\n\nI ask you to consider what a gem is truly is.

I do not think that this will help at all, if \"help\" is what I need, but I will try my best, if for nothing else but to appease him.\n\nIt is hard to lose someone and have them in your memories, in the back of your mind. They linger there, and you feel their presence, even though they're gone. It's sad, obviously Rikka! but it's a sadness that encompasses everything. I was watching Gizela today, the way she stands there, waiting for Camden to return, when we all know he won't. I know her thoughts. It's different when you are simply separated from your love. You can go about your day in a normal fashion, and sometimes you are overwhelmed by their absence. Sometimes you just want to feel them, something tangible, and you do what you can to teach patience to yourself. Brother Mason often says that Mitharu grants the greatest rewards to those who are patient, however, it is hard, and may Mitharu guide her when she finally knows the truth.

It is a strange feeling to know grief as intimately as I do, and to see it in the eyes of so many. Even Brother Mason, the most vibrant shadow of our lonely town, hides a pain. Despite his best attempts to keep it hidden, I have often seen it. He is just like all of us, a toy of Fate's cruel play. He will not speak to me about it.

Like all Alfar, their ancestral home is a frozen forest known as Glen Suthain. The Dokkalfar split from their wintry cousins, the Ljosalfar (see Chapter 8), although the reasons why are unclear. Some scholars point to the coincidence of the Durek-Alfar war as the impetus behind the separation. While many Ljosalfar remained in the cold north, the Dokkalfar settled in other parts of the lands known as Alfaria. The largest group of Dokkalfar settled in the Plains of Erathell, where they built the city of Rathir as the center of their civilization. For a more complete history of the Dokkalfar, read the Llyfarstair by Ormend of Rathir. The Founding of Rathir by Crinneus is also an excellent reference on the subject.\n\nDokkalfar Appearance\n\nThe Dokkalfar are in general identical to the Ljosalfar (see Chapter 8) in appearance except for a darker coloration of their skin. On average, they stand at 2 m tall, and weigh between 160 - 170 lbs. Scholars debate the origin of their naturally \"athletic\" biology, but most Dokkalfar conform to a slimmer body type.\n\nTypically, temporary accents to hair, face and clothing are worn to fit the situation or guest, and much of their garments are considered \"seductive\" or \"disarming\" by Almain, Ljosalfar, or even Varani standards.\n\nDokkalfar Society\n\nThe Dokkalfar worship Lyria, the goddess of magic. Their society is organized around their religion, and as a race, the Dokkalfar hold many ceremonies to honor their goddess. The government of Rathir is led by the priests and priestesses of their religion, known as the Sons or Daughters of Lyria.

No. The story of Apotyre is a tale told in the trenches, excavated from the deepest mines where the shadows never sleep and the men are buried with their pickaxes beside them.

Its fine violet splendor is familiar to us all, sparkling from the fine picture frames and jewelry boxes of our homes, glowing in the amulets and statuary of Adessa's great halls. What many forget is that the ore known to the men who mine it as \"violet flash\" is a recent discovery. Less than a century has passed since the first scholars of the ancient gnome Academy led their exploration crews to the vast wastes of Apotyre, following an unseen magical aura to an overlook of the Snaketail River. Much has been made of the importance of tyrenium in the construction of Adessa, but since its discovery, the precious purple ore has become even more synonymous with the philosophical notions - of beauty over substance, price over true worth, and most importantly, the plight of the poor against the powerful. Every piece of tyrenium carries with it a legacy of agony that began in the sands of Apotyre.\n \nThe first ever mention of tyrenium was in the published works of Scholar Joson, a quiet, headstrong gnome who would go on to sit on the founding council of Adessa's own Basilica Gnostrum, and who acted as the inaugural research fellow for Motus Mining Interests. In his description of the first wells dug in the region of Apotyre, Joson makes serveral passing remarks about a \"pleasant reflective stone -- perhaps a metal -- that appears to glitter like the scales of a snake.\" He was of course referring to unrefined tyrenium, also known as trec, which in the early days of Adessa's creation was disposed of in large, poisonous drainage pits in efforts to reach deeper for the graystone that was sought for basic masonry and construction.

All the same, one can find a village here, like any other -- the village of Canneroc.\n\nThe village name is allegedly a corruption of some fae term for the forest -- a word which has long since been forgotten. Formed by the intrepid (if not deranged) settlers that saw profit in harvesting the silk from the nests of giant spiders, Canneroc is relatively safe because it sits on an island. It is rare for the giant spiders to actively seek out prey, so the village does manage to eke out a peaceful, if not gloomy, existence. Its size has fluctuated like any town whose entire purpose is structured on a single resource -- in times when Canneroc gossamer is valuable, the amount of workers increase, and in time of poverty, they wane.\n\nBut there are those whose ancestors have been there since the town was founded. The Aidehs, as my research shows, came to the town not as silkfarmers, but to provide housing for the once-constant influx of visitors. The inn, though decrepit, still stands to this day. The Vernts are another familiy reputed in the village, and are among the oldest of the silkfarmers. Lastly, the Vauner family has been known to provide protections against the spiders for years, in the form of anti-venom.\n\nIn truth, it is a curious burg, but it is oddly impressive to visit the village and see that, though incredibly out of place, that it has stood and continues to stand.", "authors": ["Unknown  "]}, {"id": 13987, "title": "Adessa VIII", "text": "The final chapter from Galenun Hegem's memoirs, the mason who designed Adessa.\n\nChapter VIII: The Forum\n\nThe Forum would be the last of the building I would leave to my beloved city, and woe fills me for being too infirm to see to its completion.\n\nBut here, in time, will be a center for all gnomes to have a voice, to hear the words of the just and kind Templars.

The unholy apparitions have appeared as if by dark magic, behind our defenses. Despite our well manned perimeter, we have been undone.
