As part of this endeavor, we have resolved to establish a shop within the village. It is now open for business, and I look forward to seeing a great many customers visit from all over the world.\n\nWith regards to the &quot;sacrifice&quot; keyword you wrote about, one of the villagers claimed to know the meaning behind the term. You are more than welcome to speak with him on the matter as part of your visit to The Aerie.\n\nI hope to hear again from you soon.", "authors": ["Chief of The Aerie"]}, {"id": 27380, "title": "Letter to a Faraway Lover", "text": "My dearest,\n\nMy efforts at cultivating freesia have finally borne fruit!

There's nothing worse than a sad tree.</li><li>Devola and Popola came to keep me company today. They even sang a song for me! It was really great! I need to practice so I can sing to Dad when he gets back.</li><li>I'm gonna learn to make awesome food for Dad. I better start working on a new secret recipe.</li><li>Once I finish my secret dish, I'm gonna feed it to Dad!

So I just had a party by myself!</li><li>Dad said he would come back home for my birthday, but I want to celebrate his birthday once in a while!</li><li>The flower wasn't in any of Devola's books, so she said I could name it whatever I want. Maybe I'll name it after Dad!</li><li>I guess a Shade came near the village today. People kept coming up to me and saying \"Boy, we sure wish your father was around!\" And I said, \"Me too! Dad could kick the Shade's butt!\"</li><li>Got a letter from Dad today! He's in a far-away town where he can see the ocean. I hope I can see the ocean someday. I bet it's huge!</li><li>I wish I could meet the Kain\u00e9 lady Dad told me about. I bet she's really nice and always says nice things. I wonder if that's what my mom was like?</li><li>I was tired today, so I stayed home and hid in the bed. I could still hear Devola's singing from somewhere, though. Listening to her always makes me happy.</li><li>Devola and Popola went back home. That made me lonely, so I ran around singing songs as loud as I could. But then that got kinda weird and scary, so I stopped.</li><li>The village is buzzing with excitement and stuff today! I dunno what happened, but Devola told me not to worry. At first I thought it was a festival, but now I don't know.</li><li>Whenever I read a letter from Dad, I really feel like I need to see him again.</li><li>I write Dad letters every single day. He always worries about me, but I feel fine.</li><li>I wish Dad would send me letters every day like I do. But I know he's busy, so every other day is okay.</li><li>In the book, the big tree kept on waiting and waiting. I have to wait a lot, too. I wish I could do something.</li><li>Today Devola said that Kain\u00e9 is \"put together in all the right places\". I don't know what all of that means, but I wanna be like that when I grow up!</li><li>Dad came back! He came back to see me! Yaaaay Dad!</li><li>Dad left pretty quickly. He said he just stopped by so he could see my face.</li><li>These black marks keep showing up on my body.
