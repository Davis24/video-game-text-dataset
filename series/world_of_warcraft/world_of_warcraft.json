The victorious armies of Arathor returned home to southlands of Strom.\n\nThe human society of Arathor grew and prospered, yet Thoradin, fearful that his kingdom would splinter apart if it overextended itself, maintained that Strom was the center of the Arathorian empire. After many peaceful years of growth and commerce, mighty Thoradin departed on one final quest, never to return, leaving Arathor's younger generation free to expand the empire beyond the lands of Strom.\n\nThe original hundred magi, who were tutored in the ways of magic by the elves, expanded their powers and studied the mystic disciplines of spell-weaving in much greater detail. These magi, initially chosen for their strong wills and noble spirits, had always practiced their magic with care and responsibility; however, they passed their secrets and powers onto a newer generation that had no concept of the rigors of war or the necessity for self-restraint.\n\nThese younger magicians began to practice magic for personal gain rather than out of any responsibility towards their fellows.\n\nAs the empire grew and expanded into new lands, the young magicians also spread out into the southlands. Wielding their mystical powers, the magicians protected their brethren from the wild creatures of the land and made it possible for new city-states to be constructed in the wilderness. Yet, as their powers grew, the magicians became ever more conceited and isolated from the rest of society.\n\nThe second Arathorian city-state of Dalaran was founded in the lands north of Strom. Many fledgling wizards left the restraining confines of Strom behind and traveled to Dalaran, where they hoped to use their new powers with greater freedom. These magicians used their skills to build up the enchanted spires of Dalaran and reveled in the pursuit of their studies.\n\nThe citizens of Dalaran tolerated the magicians' endeavors and built up a bustling economy under the protection of their magic-using defenders. Yet, as more and more magicians practiced their arts, the fabric of reality around Dalaran began to weaken and tear.\n\nThe sinister agents of the Burning Legion, who had been banished when the Well of Eternity collapsed, were lured back into the world by the heedless spellcasting of the magicians of Dalaran. Though these relatively weak demons did not appear in force, they did sew considerable confusion and chaos within the streets of Dalaran.\n\nMost of these demonic encounters were isolated events, and the ruling Magocrats did what they could to keep such events hidden from the public. The most powerful magicians were sent to capture the elusive demons, but they often found themselves hopelessly outmatched by the lone agents of the mighty Legion.\n\nAfter a few months the superstitious peasantry began to suspect that their sorcerous rulers were hiding something terrible from them. Rumors of revolution began to sweep through the streets of Dalaran as the paranoid citizenry questioned the motives and practices of the magicians they had once admired. The Magocrats, fearing that the peasants would revolt and that Strom would take action against them, turned to the only group they felt would understand their particular problem: the elves.\n\nUpon hearing the Magocrats' news of demonic activity in Dalaran, the elves quickly dispatched their mightiest wizards to the human lands. The elven wizards studied the energy currents in Dalaran and made detailed reports of all demonic activity that they beheld. They concluded that although there were only a few demons loose in the world, the Legion itself would remain a dire threat so long as humans continued to wield the forces of magic.\n\nThe Council of Silvermoon, which ruled over the elves of Quel'Thalas, entered into a secret pact with the Magocrat lords of Dalaran. The elves told the Magocrats about the history of ancient Kalimdor and of the Burning Legion, a history which still threatened the world. They informed the humans that so long as they used magic, they would need to protect their citizenry from the malicious agents of the Legion.\n\nThe Magocrats proposed the notion of empowering a single mortal champion who would utilize their powers in order to fight a never-ending secret war against the Legion. It was stressed that the majority of mankind could never know about the Guardians or the threat of the Legion for fear that they would riot in fear and paranoia. The elves agreed to the proposal and founded a secret society that would watch over the selection of the Guardian and help to stem the rise of chaos in the world.\n\nThe society held its secret meetings in the shadowed Tirisfal Glades, where the high elves had first settled in Lordaeron. Thus, they named the secret sect the Guardians of Tirisfal. The mortal champions who were chosen to be Guardians were imbued with incredible powers of both elven and human magic. Though there would only ever be one Guardian at a time, they held such vast power that they could single-handedly fight back the Legion's agents wherever they were found in the world.\n\nThe Guardian power was so great that only the Council of Tirisfal was allowed to choose potential successors to the mantle of Guardianship. Whenever a Guardian grew too old, or wearied of the secret war against chaos, the Council chose a new champion, and under controlled conditions, formally channeled the Guardian power into its new agent.\n\nAs the generations passed, Guardians defended the masses of humanity from the invisible threat of the Burning Legion throughout the lands of Arathor and Quel'Thalas. Arathor grew and prospered while the use of magic spread throughout the empire. Meanwhile, the Guardians kept careful watch for signs of demonic activity.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14014", "title": "Crafty's Shopping List", "text": "Okay, $N, this is a list of all the stuff that I'm going to need for our new super-secret, er..., super weapon.

The dwarves and the tauren especially look to a legend of the coming Winter Veil - the blanketing of the land in snow, thus heralding a time of renewal - as a time for celebration. Though the understanding of the legends that the races of Azeroth share are not dissimilar, the ways they choose to acknowledge them are as diverse as the races themselves.\n\nThe Legend of Greatfather Winter\n\nThe term \"Winter Veil\" is said to stem from a supernatural being referred in many cultures to as Greatfather Winter. As he would walk the land late in the seasons, winter itself would be his billowing cloak. In his wake was the blanketing of the land in snow, and thus it is said that Greatfather Winter would cast his wintry veil over the land. Though parts of Azeroth may lie in snow, it gives the land time for rebirth and renewal.\n\nThe Dwarves\n\nEver consumed with the research of their origins, the dwarves choose to celebrate the season as a recognition of Greatfather Winter himself. They consider him to be the personification of one of the ancients of Azeroth - the titans. Much as they claim lineage in one degree or another to these mystical beings, they consider their snowy home of Dun Morogh as the prime example of Greatfather Winter's blessings.\n\nThe Tauren\n\nThe tauren and their shamanistic understanding of winter, along with their recent emergence into druidic endeavors, fit in well with the legend of Winter Veil. They focus almost entirely on the renewing aspects of the lore however, leaving legend worship to those races (as they view it) less in tune with the nature of things. Many tauren choose this time as the right time to give thanks for the blessings of their new home in Mulgore.\n\nFeasting\n\nThe idea of feasting during this time of year is one that traces its origins to the legend itself. As Greatfather Winter walked Azeroth, bringing winter in his wake, it is said he would provide a bounty for those who welcomed his presence. As such, the idea of feasting during the Winter Veil would bring together communities as they shared whatever they had. Typically, a single day of merriment and feasting welcomed the change, all in anticipation of the land's renewal.\n\nModern Day Observation\n\nOther cultures have begun to recognize the Feast of Winter Veil as a time of great celebration, though not in the same traditions as the legend bases it in. Customs, often unrelated to anything other than a chance for celebration and gift exchange, have made their way into modern day observation of the season. Even the image of Greatfather Winter is sometimes used, but more as a harbinger of commercial exploit rather than as a supernatural titan.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14027", "title": "Spy's Report", "text": "--Day 13\n\nTroop movement near Theramore has increased.

Even the mantid keep a fair distance from this one. Last seen off the northwestern coast of Zan'vess.\n\nODD'NIROK\n\nOdd'nirok does not fight with his claws as the other makrura do. Instead, he possesses a crude shamanic power, fighting with the force of water itself. He was last seen on the shores south of the cliffs of Sik'vess, in Townlong Steppes.\n\nCLAWLORD KRIL'MANDAR\n\nWhile we are discussing makrura, I must mention Kril'mandar, known as the Clawlord, or the Terror of the Southern Tide.\n\nKril'mandar has NOT been seen in years.

Despite the trolls' attempts to keep them from expanding their territories, the night elves built up a mighty empire that expanded rapidly across primordial Kalimdor. Wielding fierce magics never before imagined by the superstitious trolls, the night elves had little trouble doing what the evil aqir could never do: topple the two greatest empires in the world.\n\nThe night elves systematically dismantled the troll's defenses and supply chains. The trolls, unable to counter the elves' destructive magics, buckled under the onslaught. The night elves proved to be every bit as cunning and bloodthirsty as the savage trolls -- incurring the latter race's eternal hatred and disdain. The Gurubashi and Amani empires fragmented within only a few short years.\n\nEventually, the night elves were burned by the arcane fires they had sought to control. Their reckless use of magic had lured the demonic Burning Legion to the world. The demons crushed much of the night elves' civilization. Though there are no records to indicate that the Legion attacked either troll civilization, it is likely that battles took place across the breadth of the continent.\n\nAt the end of this terrible conflict -- known as the War of the Ancients -- the Well of Eternity imploded. The resulting shockwave shattered the greater landmass of Kalimdor. The center of the continent was blasted beneath the sea, leaving only a small group of broken, single continents.\n\nThus, great chunks of both the Amani and Gurubashi Empires still exist in the present day lands of Quel'Thalas and Stranglethorn (respectively).

The streaming ripples of energy were felt by terrible alien minds. Sargeras - the Great Enemy of all life, the Destroyer of Worlds - felt the potent ripples and was drawn to their distant point of origin.\n\nSpying the primordial world of Azeroth and sensing the limitless energies of the Well of Eternity, Sargeras was consumed by an insatiable hunger. The great dark god of the Nameless Void resolved to destroy the fledgling world and claim its energies as his own.\n\nSargeras gathered his vast Burning Legion and made his way towards the unsuspecting world of Azeroth. The Legion was comprised of a million screaming demons, all ripped from the far corners of the universe, and the demons hungered for conquest. Sargeras' lieutenants, Archimonde the Defiler and Mannoroth the Destructor, prepared their infernal minions to strike.\n\nQueen Azshara, overwhelmed by the terrible ecstasy of her magic, fell victim to Sargeras' undeniable power and agreed to grant him entrance to her world. Even her Highborne servitors gave themselves over to magic's inevitable corruption and began to worship Sargeras as their god. To show their allegiance to the Legion, the Highborne aided their queen in opening a vast, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity.\n\nOnce all his preparations had been made, Sargeras began his catastrophic invasion of Azeroth. The warrior-demons of the Burning Legion stormed into the world through the Well of Eternity and laid siege to the night elves' sleeping cities. Led by Archimonde and Mannoroth, the Legion swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor, leaving only ash and sorrow in its wake.\n\nThe demon warlocks called down searing infernals that crashed like hellish meteors into the graceful spires of Kalimdor's temples. A band of burning, bloodletting killers known as the Doomguard marched across Kalimdor's fields, slaughtering everyone in their path. Packs of wild, demonic felhounds ravaged the countryside unopposed. Though the brave Kaldorei warriors rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion's onslaught.\n\nIt fell to Malfurion Stormrage to find help for his beleaguered people. Stormrage, whose own brother, Illidan, practiced the Highborne's magics, was incensed by the growing corruption amongst the upper class. Convincing Illidan to forsake his dangerous obsession, Malfurion set out to find Cenarius and muster a resistance force.\n\nThe beautiful young priestess, Tyrande, agreed to accompany the brothers in the name of Elune. Though Malfurion and Illidan shared a love for the idealistic priestess, Tyrande's heart belonged to Malfurion alone. Illidan resented his brother's budding romance with Tyrande, but knew that his heartache was nothing compared to the pain of his magical addiction.\n\nIllidan, who had grown dependent on magic's empowering energies, struggled to keep control of his nearly overwhelming hunger to tap the Well's energies once again. However, with Tyrande's patient support, he was able to restrain himself and help his brother find the reclusive demigod, Cenarius.\n\nCenarius, who dwelt within the sacred Moonglades of the distant Mount Hyjal, agreed to help the night elves by finding the ancient dragons and enlisting their aid. The dragons, led by the great red leviathan, Alexstrasza, agreed to send their mighty flights to engage the demons and their infernal masters.\n\nCenarius, calling on the spirits of the enchanted forests, rallied an army of ancient tree-men and led them against the Legion in a daring ground assault. As the night elves' allies converged upon Azshara's temple and the Well of Eternity, all-out warfare erupted. Despite the strength of their newfound allies, Malfurion and his colleagues realized that the Legion could not be defeated by martial strength alone.\n\nAs the titanic battle raged around Azshara's capital city, the delusional queen waited in anticipation for Sargeras' arrival. The lord of the Legion was preparing to pass through the Well of Eternity and enter the ravaged world. As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well's surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers. Only by linking their magics together in one focused spell would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.\n\nAs the battle raged across the burning fields of Kalimdor, a terrible turn of events unfolded. The details of the event have been lost to time, but it is known that Neltharion, the Dragon Aspect of the Earth, went mad during a critical engagement against the Burning Legion. He began to split apart as flame and rage erupted from his dark hide. Renaming himself Deathwing, the burning dragon turned on his brethren and drove the five dragonflights from the field of battle.\n\nDeathwing's sudden betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. Wounded and shocked, Alexstrasza and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. Malfurion and his companions, now hopelessly outnumbered, barely survived the ensuing onslaught.\n\nMalfurion, convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons' umbilical link to the physical world, insisted that it should be destroyed. His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were horrified by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory, so she convinced Cenarius and their comrades to storm Azshara's temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14049", "title": "Turning the Other Cheek", "text": "The topic of indulgences is a difficult one, but at times in our lives, it becomes a necessary evil.

Their dedication to engineering as a collective whole has not only fueled fantastic inventions in what is arguably a magical Age of Invention, but it also fueled their intense racial rivalry. Nowhere is this more evident than in their divergent disciplines.\n\nGnome Engineering\n\nThe gnomes as a race tend to excel in the design of items intended to manipulate and control the world around them. While they maintain a cursory understanding of explosives and weaponry, gnome engineering focuses instead on items that quite literally try to make life easier and more accessible. It is a discipline of theoretical possibilities made reality through gnomish know-how. Some possibilities, however, are never fully realized.\n\nGoblin Engineering\n\nAs a race that finds itself as neutral in almost every conflict, goblins have taken great steps to turn science into profit. They embrace the practical applications of engineering, as evident in their radical designs of explosives, firearms, and machinery. Goblin engineering only maintains a passing interest in engineering theory; their inventions usually don't have the issue of not working, but rather working too well. It is certainly not for the faint of heart.\n\nDiscipline Study\n\nGnomes and goblins protect their knowledge from each other to such lengths that it is nigh impossible to access both sets of disciplines simultaneously. Each race, regardless of political affiliations, keeps the knowledge of these disciplines available only to those who agree to forgo pursuit of the other's discipline. If a student chooses to embrace gnome engineering, for example, then no knowledge of goblin engineering will ever be made available to them.\n\nPermanent Decisions\n\nThe previous section highlighted an important point about the two engineering disciplines that must be reiterated for the sake of education. A decision to engage in either of the two disciplines means that the opposing discipline's schemata will not be available for study. While such finality may be daunting to the layman engineer, the seasoned one understands that gnomes and goblins guard their secrets with complete fervor; some knowledge is always better than none.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"You want to know about goblin engineering?

Known for humble yet hardworking residents, Darrowshire stayed in the background of Lordaeron history until the Second War.\n\nHeroes were made during that war. And heroes were lost.\n\nThe Battle of Darrowshire\n\nThe Battle of Darrowshire took place in the middle of the Second War, when scourge forces rampaged across Lordaeron. Darrowshire was cut off from the bulk of Alliance forces, but the town was bolstered by a company of troops, a contingent of paladins of the Silver Hand, and a staunch group of local militia led by Captain Joseph Redpath.\n\nThe Scourge's first assaults on Darrowshire were sparse. Small groups of marauding skeletons and corpses wandered the outskirts of the village and were easily defeated. But the Scourge sensed the defenders' tenacity, and responded in kind; soon after the first wave of attacks a second wave emerged. Champion ghouls, servants of the ghoul lord Horgus, screamed down from the hills and clashed with beleaguered Darrowshire defenders.\n\nThe Defenders weakened, but were relieved by paladins, disciples of the Silver Hand. Their leader, Davil Crokford, was a native of Darrowshire. He brought his followers to the village when he heard of the impending attack, and together with the defenders they held back the servants of Horgus.\n\nWhen Horgus himself entered the battle, he met with Davil. For many minutes they fought and Davil eventually prevailed, but he suffered a mortal wound and died soon after defeating the ghoul lord.\n\nThe battle continued, and Captain Redpath led his militia bravely. And it might have been won, had the captain not been corrupted by the death knight Marduk the Black.\n\nIn the middle of the fray Marduk rode up to Redpath, and with black magic he tore loose Redpath's spirit, twisting it into an evil shadow of the brave captain.\n\nThe corrupted Captain Redpath then spread his evil taint among the defenders of Darrowshire, who betrayed their allies and slaughtered them. They then turned on the town of Darrowshire and killed all who hid in their homes.\n\nThe remaining scourge army, along with the corrupted spirit of Captain Redpath, then left the ravaged village of Darrowshire and tore into Lordaeron, adding to the pain and death of the Second War.\n\nThe Fate of Horgus the Ravager\n\nHorgus the Ravager fell at the Battle of Darrowshire. But the evil within him was not fully spent. The victorious Scourge forces removed his skull from the battlefield of Darrowshire, carrying it with them to sow dread among the living they faced.\n\nDays later, the company of Scourge who possessed the head were defeated by Silver Hand Paladins. Horgus' head was cast into Blackwood Lake.\n\nThe Fate of Marduk the Black\n\nMarduk survived the Second War, causing great death and suffering with his foul, rune-laden sword. Although Marduk still lives, his sword was lost in a battle near Corin's Crossing. A dwarf captain shattered the sword on his enchanted shield, forcing Marduk to flee the field and winning the day for the Alliance.\n\nMarduk's sword sank into the earth and corrupted it, eating a gorge into the land, now known as the Infectis Scar.\n\nThe Fate of Davil Lightfire\n\nDavil Lightfire died at the Battle of Darrowshire, but his bravery inspired the Alliance throughout the war.\n\nHis book, his paladin's libram, was recovered by Scarlet Crusade troops. It now resides in the town hall of the Scarlet Crusade controlled Hearthglen, often read by crusaders eager to draw from Davil's strength.\n\nThe Fate of Joseph Redpath\n\nJoseph Redpath was killed during the Battle of Darrowshire. His spirit was corrupted and took new shape, and this creature spread great evil in Lordaeron.\n\nAt Gahrron's Withering, east of Andorhal, the corrupted Redpath was finally defeated by Alliance forces. His shield still rests near the barn of the plagued farmstead, and Scourge minions are still drawn to the memory of his evil.\n\nThe Fate of Carlin Redpath\n\nBrother to Captain Joseph Redpath, Carlin fell during the battle of Darrowshire. But although terribly wounded, he was not slain.\n\nDays after the battle, agents of the Argent Dawn found Carlin wandering, weak from thirst and fever, near Corin's Crossing. They tended to his wounds and brought him to the Light's Hope Chapel.\n\nGrateful for their charity, Carlin joined the ranks of the Argent Dawn and now fights a battle of revenge against the Scourge.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14055", "title": "Gnoll Attack Orders", "text": "Minions, our leader has spoken.

The tribes of early humanity raided each other's settlements with little heed for racial unification or honor.\n\nYet one tribe, known as the Arathi, saw that the trolls were becoming too great a threat to ignore. The Arathi wished to bring all of the tribes under its rule so that they could provide a unified front against the troll warbands.\n\nOver the course of six years, the cunning Arathi outmaneuvered and outfought the rival tribes. After every victory, the Arathi offered peace and equality to the conquered people; thus, they won the loyalty of those they had beaten. Eventually the Arathi tribe came to include many disparate tribes, and the ranks of its army grew vast.\n\nConfident that they could hold their own against the troll warbands or even the reclusive elves if need be, the Arathi warlords decided to construct a mighty fortress city in the southern regions of Lordaeron. The city-state, named Strom, became the capital of the Arathi nation, Arathor. As Arathor prospered, humans from all over the vast continent traveled south to the protection and safety of Strom.\n\nUnited under one banner, the human tribes developed a strong, optimistic culture. Thoradin, the king of Arathor, knew that the mysterious elves in the northlands were under constant siege by the trolls, but refused to risk the safety of his people in defense of reclusive strangers. Many months passed as rumors of the elves' supposed defeat trickled down from the north. It was only when weary ambassadors from Quel'Thalas reached Strom that Thoradin realized how great the troll threat truly was.\n\nThe elves informed Thoradin that the troll armies were vast and that once the trolls had destroyed Quel'Thalas, they would move on to attack the southlands. The desperate elves, in dire need of military aid, hastily agreed to teach certain select humans to wield magic in exchange for their help against the warbands.\n\nThoradin, distrustful of any magic, agreed to aid the elves out of necessity. Almost immediately, elven sorcerers arrived in Arathor and began to instruct a group of humans in the ways of magic.\n\nThe elves found that although humans were innately clumsy in their handling of magic, they possessed a startling natural affinity for it. One hundred men were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls. Convinced that their human students were ready to aid in the struggle, the elves left Strom and traveled north alongside the mighty armies of King Thoradin.\n\nThe united elf and human armies clashed against the overwhelming troll warbands at the foot of the Alterac Mountains. The battle lasted for many days, but the unflagging armies of Arathor never tired or gave an inch of ground before the troll onslaught. The elven lords deemed that the time had come to release the powers of their magic upon the enemy.\n\nThe hundred human magi and a multitude of elven sorcerers called down the fury of the heavens and set the troll armies ablaze. The elemental fires prevented the trolls from regenerating their wounds and burned their tortured forms from the inside out.\n\nAs the troll armies broke and attempted to flee, Thoradin's armies ran them down and slaughtered every last one of their soldiers. The trolls would never fully recover from their defeat, and history would never see the trolls rise as one nation again.

A noble giant of molten bronze, Sargeras carried out his duties for countless millennia, seeking out and destroying these demons wherever he could find them.\n\nAlthough Sargeras' nearly limitless powers made short work of the shambling demons he found throughout the Great Dark, he was greatly troubled by the creatures' corruption and all-consuming evil. Incapable of fathoming such depravity, the great Titan began to slip into a brooding depression. Despite his growing unease, Sargeras rid the universe of demonic entities by trapping them within a corner of the Twisting Nether.\n\nWhile his confusion and misery deepened, Sargeras was forced to contend with a particularly insidious group intent on disrupting the Titans' order: the Nathrezim. This dark race of vampiric demons (also known as dreadlords) conquered a number of populated worlds by possessing their inhabitants and turning them to the shadow.\n\nThe nefarious, scheming dreadlords turned whole nations against one another by manipulating them into unthinking hatred and mistrust. Sargeras defeated the Nathrezim easily, but their corruption affected him deeply.\n\nAs doubt and despair overwhelmed Sargeras' senses, he lost all faith not only in his mission, but also in the Titans' vision of an ordered universe. Eventually he came to believe that the concept of order itself was folly, and that chaos and depravity were the only absolutes within the dark, lonely universe.\n\nHis fellow Titans tried to persuade him of his error and calm his raging emotions, but he disregarded their more optimistic beliefs as self-serving delusions. Storming from their ranks forever, Sargeras set out to find his own place in the universe. Although the Pantheon was sorrowful at his departure, the Titans could never have predicted just how far their lost brother would go.\n\nBy the time Sargeras' madness had consumed the last vestiges of his valiant spirit, he believed that the Titans themselves were responsible for creation's failure. Deciding, at last, to undo their works throughout the universe, he resolved to form an unstoppable army that would set the physical universe aflame.\n\nEven Sargeras' titanic form became distorted from the corruption that plagued his once-noble heart. His eyes, hair, and beard erupted in fire, and his metallic bronze skin split open to reveal an endless furnace of blistering hate.\n\nIn his fury, Sargeras shattered the prisons he'd created and set the loathsome demons free. These cunning creatures bowed before the dark Titan's vast rage and offered to serve him in whatever malicious ways they could. Seeking a way to lead and control his vast demonic army, Sargeras recruited (and subsequently corrupted) the ancient and intelligent race of the Eredar. From within their ranks, Sargeras picked two champions to command his demonic army of destruction.\n\nKil'jaeden the Deceiver was chosen to seek out the darkest races in the universe and recruit them into Sargeras' ranks. The second champion, Archimonde the Defiler, was chosen to lead Sargeras' vast armies into battle against any who might resist the Titan's will.\n\nKil'jaeden's first move was to enslave the vampiric dreadlords under his terrible power. The dreadlords served as his personal agents throughout the universe, and they took pleasure in locating primitive races for their master to corrupt and bring into the fold. First amongst the dreadlords was Tichondrius the Darkener. Tichondrius served Kil'jaeden as the perfect soldier and agreed to bring Sargeras' burning will to all the dark corners of the universe.\n\nThe mighty Archimonde also empowered agents of his own. Calling upon the malefic pit lords and their barbarous leader, Mannoroth the Destructor, Archimonde hoped to establish a fighting elite that would scour creation of all life.\n\nOnce Sargeras saw that his armies were amassed and ready to follow his every command, he launched his raging forces into the vastness of the Great Dark. He referred to his growing army as the Burning Legion.

Perhaps it is as if I'm confessing my sins to a silent companion, or freeing my mind of these tortured thoughts and confining them to paper. I began a journal before this one, but it remains in a place to which I cannot return. So I will start afresh. But this time, I will start from the true beginning.\n\nIt began with the finding of that cursed scythe in the mine they call Roland's Doom. Yes, that was the start of it. Before that, the Defias Brotherhood was happy with our progress in Duskwood. Before the Scythe, the terrors of this place seemed as tame as Northshire Valley.\n\nBut ever since I found the haft of the Scythe jutting from that pile of rubble in the mine and, curse me, pulled it free, Roland's Doom became a place of vile death!\n\nIf I had known what would happen, I would have cut off my own hand to keep from grasping that rune-carved wood. So many regrets! I always thought that was a privilege of the old. I now know that it is not the old - it is the hopeless - who don the mantle of regret, unable and unwilling to shrug it from shoulders stooped with misery.\n\nBut enough waxing like a pipe-mad poet. I must continue with the chronicle...\n\nAfter the Scythe was freed, a change rippled through the mine. Light from our flickering torches warped, and the strength of our voices seemed beyond our control. Sometimes a man's whisper roared through the tunnels forcing hands on ears, and sometimes our shouts barely traveled a few steps before diminishing into a hint on the wind.\n\nUnnerving, yes, but we did not have long to wonder at this strangeness. It was but a harbinger of what truly drove us from the mine. The Worgen.\n\nThey came at us from everywhere, clawing from hidden holes at our feet and dropping upon us from silent perches above. Half our men fell in those first panicked minutes. The rest, including myself, tried to flee. As I ran I saw so many of my brothers taken by tooth and claw, heard so many screams cut short or gurgle to silence.\n\nFor all I know, I am the only human to escape that place.\n\nI can only guess why I survived that night. I have always been cautious, always quick to flinch from jabs and leap free of pitfalls. My nickname, Jitters, comes from this trait. So perhaps it was just that knack for caution that saved me...Or maybe it was the Scythe I pulled from the rubble. It cannot be the Scythe itself, for I lost it during my frantic flight. But if it was I who brought the Worgen to Duskwood, then perhaps the Worgen afforded me a rare courtesy. Curse them.\n\nOr perhaps, I am doomed to witness the change I wrought on Duskwood. Perhaps it is my fate to watch as the Worgen tear into this land, staining it ever darker with their foulness.\n\nIf that truly is my fate, then it is twofold. For the Worgen are not the only power to clutch at Duskwood - the fiends from Deadwind Pass have also staked claim.\n\nThat is the next chapter of my tale, and I pray it is the last...\n\nAfter surviving the flight from Roland's Doom, I hid within a barn owned by a man named Sven. I spent a few days in the barn, and such horror lingered with me that I never once made myself known to Sven or his family. But from what I saw from my hiding place, I knew these farmers were quite decent folk. Had I stepped from my concealment I think they would have taken me in, but trust is hard for me. Harder still after that shock in the mine.\n\nSo I remained hidden. And it saved my life.\n\nA few days after I arrived at the barn, Sven left his farm for Darkshire. He kissed his wife and smiled to his children and promised to return soon with toys and sweets. The poor man. That was the last time he saw his family unmutilated. \n\nAt least they parted happily. And at least his wife was the first to die, and was freed from seeing the slaughter of her children. But these small graces do nothing for me. I saw what happened, and it will ever haunt my dreams.\n\nMy hand trembles as I recall the details of that night, when Sven was away and his family was doomed to face the Black Riders alone. Again regret claws at me, for I was there and could have risen against those fiends from Deadwind Pass. But it is a false regret. It is the same that plagues any survivor of a tragedy. I know that, had I left my place of hiding I too would have been killed, my body ripped and torn, and its pieces spread so widely that I would not be recognized.\n\nBut, even though I know I could have done nothing to stop this heinous murder, one true regret does remain: I brought the Black Riders to Sven's farm. My discovery of the Scythe not only unleashed the Worgen upon Duskwood - it drew the Riders from Deadwind Pass.\n\nI know this because, just before they began their slaughter they asked one question to Sven's wife as she held her children close, giving them what comfort she could though she was certain death was near.\n\n\"The Scythe of Elune.\" one of the Riders shrieked in a voice both harsh and shrill, like the grinding of an axe on stone. And the last word - Elune - it croaked, as if choking on the sound.\n\nDread gripped me when I heard that voice, both from the horrid sound of it, and because...I knew the Scythe of which the Rider spoke. It must be the same cursed thing I drew from the rocks of Roland's Doom days before. It was what the Black Riders sought!\n\nAnd it was what would kill Sven's family.\n\nI never learned the name of Sven's wife, as she was only ever called \"dearest,\" and \"my love,\" and \"mommy\" by her husband and children. But I wish I knew it. I am the only living memory of her deed that day, and although she was just a farmer's wife, never have I seen a man or woman act with such bravery.\n\nOf course she did not know of the Scythe, but when she learned the Riders sought it, in an instant a plan formed in her head.\n\nAnd it was bold and clever. If only it had worked.\n\n\"The Scythe?\" she said in a calm voice. \"Of course I do. Who here wouldn't?\" She looked at the Riders with steady eyes, and I would have sworn she spoke the truth if I had not known better. There was no way she could know about the Scythe.\n\nHer gambit paid off. The same Rider who uttered the question before bent his head slightly toward her, and shrieked, \"Where?\"\n\n\"I'll take you. All of you,\" she said, and I could see a small hope flicker behind her eyes.\n\n\"But the way is far, and my children would slow us. We must leave them.\"\n\nHer trick was simple, but simple tricks have the best hope of success. If it worked, it would lead the Riders away from the farm. She would be lost, but her children would be safe. And it would work, if only the Riders believed her noble lies.\n\nAlthough I have never been a student of the Light, I prayed fiercely for Sven's wife as she stood against those terrible Riders.\n\n\"Please,\" I prayed. \"Let them believe.\"\n\nThey stood, frozen, and she met their gazes with calm. Then one rider looked up, as if hearing a distant call. He drew from his garb a small gem and peered into it. He then gestured with the bauble toward Sven's wife. A light crept from the Rider toward the woman, shaping itself into a grim, white hand. She stared into the light, unflinching, but I could see uncertainty behind her mask of confidence. When the hand reached her, it spread its fingers over her head. \n\nAnd it squeezed.\n\nSven's wife stood rigid as a board, and her eyes grew wide. And although her lips pulled back to mouth a scream, no sound escaped. After a few moments of this torture the hand released her, dropping her to her knees. The Rider who held the bauble then sat erect in his saddle, and a loud voice erupted from it.\n\n\"This woman lies,\" it said in a voice that has scarred my dreams. \"She has not seen the Scythe.\"\n\nAfter this, the Rider's shoulders stooped slightly, as if a spirit within him had fled. And then in the old, shrieking voice it used earlier, these final words were uttered:\n\n\"The Lord has spoken. Kill them.\"\n\nI cannot describe what happened next. It is clear in my mind, but even my wretched soul cannot put to paper the events of those next few, grisly minutes.\n\nI can only write that Sven's family was killed. And soon after, Sven returned to this grim, deathly scene. Such grief was in him that I was afraid to show myself. And so afraid was I that he would find me, I fled from my hiding spot in the barn.

The lives of my fallen comrades will not be in vain, and I shall avenge their deaths using the Scythe of Elune. It is an ancient thing, a branch, twisted and gnarled of wood that could be older than even the Kaldorei.\n\nFor many hours I examined the tool that the goddess granted to me. It is no ordinary weapon, that is for certain, nor is it a simple magical implement. With it... it is as though the barriers of time and space are weakened.\n\nHolding the Scythe in my hands, I received a vision of chaos. Wolf-men... the worgen... battled an incredible enemy. The worgen fought savagely, as fit their primitive race, but their enemy was unflinching: the Lords of the Emerald Flame.\n\nAnd that was when I realized the true power of the Scythe. By focusing on it, I became able to communicate with the worgen. It was not speech I used to contact them, however. It was something different... I could not describe it.\n\nWhat mattered was that the worgen heard and understood me. By further channeling energy into the Scythe, the barriers weakened more, and I was able to draw worgen into our world. A score and half I was able to summon in my first attempt. They followed me into battle, and with their brutish strength at my command, we tore into the demons of Felwood.\n\nElune has granted my wishes. The forest will be cleansed.\n\nMay Elune's blessings be upon me until my work is done.\n\nAll goes well. I have summoned larger numbers of worgen to fight at my side. Though they are of simple mind, they have shown impressive ability to coordinate their attacks and function as a group.\n\nI have identified leaders in their packs. To them I have given command of small groups of warriors. We strike from many places in the forest at once, and my campaign against the demons is a fruitful one.\n\nMay Elune's blessings be upon me until my work is done.\n\nA pack is lost. I sent the worgen to range through the forest and identify areas of demonic infestation, but they did not return. I begin to worry about the leaders that I have entrusted control to. They are of simple mind, and this small bit of authority I have given them, they stretch to the utmost. Am I losing control? Perhaps I shall cease summoning additional worgen for the time being.\n\nMay Elune's blessings be upon me until my work is done.\n\nThough I have not summoned additional worgen, their numbers continue to increase. It is as though the Scythe no longer requires my intervention for the summoning process. This is troubling. I have gathered as many of the packs as I could find, and ordered them to remain at the Shrine of Mel'Thandris.\n\nMeanwhile, I have searched the libraries in Darnassus and consulted with the Circle of Ancients in Darkshore. Not one scrap of information about these worgen did I find. I have heard reports, whispers, of a wizard of the Kirin Tor named Arugal. From what I have heard, it is possible that he has also summoned worgen. I would consult with this wizard--distasteful as it may be--and see what he knows.\n\nThe worgen are dangerous, and I wish to stem the tide.

So our council of six warlocks gathered to discuss how best to investigate the new magics witnessed by these threats.\n\nAt first, the six of us refused to cooperate, tossing blame and bickering as easily as shadowbolts and curses. Finally, after several nights, the human Kanrethad spoke out:\n\n\"In the wake of the Cataclysm, the rising tensions between the Horde and Alliance have driven the greatest heroes of Azeroth to train for war. Warriors have readied their war banners, the Death Knights of Acherus have learned to control the undead and it is even said the Mages are researching ways to undo time itself.\"\n\n\"The relentless darkness which bathed Azeroth has been pushed back. Cho'gall is slain and the remnants of the Twilight's Hammer cult have been scattered. Ragnaros is defeated and his armies forced back into the Firelands. Deathwing lies torn apart and his Twilight drakes obliterated. However, the powers they commanded are not so easily forgotten... powers untapped and ripe for the taking.\"\n\n\"In fact, among us now stands several who have faced their power firsthand,\" he said, pointing at a hooded figure across the room. A deep, sinister laugh echoed from the hood as it burst into flames and burned away to reveal the orc enchanter, Ritssyn.\n\n\"It is true, pink skin, I was there when the Firelord was vanquished. The intensity of his flame was unlike anything you can imagine.\" The burning glow of Ritssyn's eyes cast eerie shadows over his burn-scarred face and thick-tusked grin.\n\n\"Untrue,\" spat a sharp, feminine voice. Shinfel, a Blood Elf adorned with sharp spikes of Twilight elementium, glared across the table, \"Until you've been a prisoner within your own mind, you know nothing of horror.\" Shinfel's blood had been corrupted during the fight with Cho'gall and her arms were now covered in black marks left behind by the corruption that had erupted from her skin. The experience had only served to increase the intensity of her sadism.\n\nShinfel continued, \"Even the Firelord's flames were overshadowed by the raw chaos unleashed by the Destroyer.\" She paused a moment and glanced to the worgen who remained eerily silent. Zinnin had been present when Deathwing was unmade and had not spoken a word since. Zinnin's eyes narrowed for a moment, then snarled at Ritssyn. \n\nKanrethad stood up from the table and took a deep breath. \"This is exactly why we are here. I have no love for any of you, but we each bore witness to pieces of even greater power. Imagine - if we fused the molten fury of the Firelands with the unstoppable chaos of Deathwing. Even the powers of the Burning Legion could not hold a candle to our flames!\"\n\nRitssyn kicked his boots upon the table and snickered, \"And just who would do this? You?\" he spat. \"I think not. You haven't been seen in battle since the siege of the Black Temple. If it weren't for having shared the secrets of Illidan's transformation with this council, I would kill you just for having the audacity of summoning me.\"\n\nKanrethad's lips pursed for a moment, but he relaxed and continued. \"No. The scope of this task exceeds the capabilities of any single member here. I propose this council split into pairs. Ritssyn and Zinnin would lead a group into Sulfuras. Similarly, Shinfel and Zelifrax would hunt down the remaining members of the Twilight's Hammer cult and ... persuade them to share what they learned.\"\n\nThe pock-faced gnome applauded with mirthful glee.\n\nKanrethad continued, \"Then we return... one year from now and take the results of our expeditions back to our own sects, more powerful than we would have been alone.\"\n\nRitssyn frowned as he saw the greed drawn out in the human's words dance across the council's faces. \"And what would keep us from simply killing our partner in their sleep once it was a success?\"\n\nKanrethad's brow furrowed and he growled, \"Which is why we swear that if any member of this council breaks the contract and fails to return or returns alone, the others shall strike them down and banish their soul forever. We either succeed together or die alone.\"\n\nRitssyn was a powerful warlock, and could probably defeat Kanrethad by himself. But against all five of us? We all saw his hesitation. We all let our hands drift toward our scrolls and weapons.\n\n\"Fine,\" Ritssyn reluctantly agreed. \"I can play along with your fool's errand, but first I must know, where will you and that miserable forsaken, Jubeka, be going?\"\n\n\"Me?\" spoke Kanrethad with a wicked grin. \"Why I'm returning... to Outland.\"", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14093", "title": "Calor's Note", "text": "Master Carevin,\n\nThe bearer of this note has shown &lt;himself/herself&gt; to be upstanding in the Light, capable of battling the undead and demons that plague the borders of Duskwood, and willing to join the Carevin family in their cause of Light.\n\nI would thereby suggest that you give this warrior of the Light further duties--perhaps to investigate some of the townsfolk that are under suspicion of succor to the enemies of the Light.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCalor", "authors": ["Calor "]}, {"id": "14094", "title": "Creatures That Owe Sal'salabim Golds", "text": "(1) Raliq the Drunk: Ogre.

The pages are filled with random notes, the occasional drawing of an imp's internal organs and the occasional tidbit on the preferred diet of felhunters.\n\nNear the end, an entry catches your eye...\n\nDay 26:\n\nIt has been nearly two weeks since Kanrethad and I arrived in Outland. Almost immediately afterwards, he departed for Shadowmoon Valley. I didn't bother to ask why, as long as he doesn't get himself killed. My research here in this dusty wasteland continues as drudgingly expected. While the Legion's onslaught has subsided, a number of the rarer demon specimens remain.\n\nDay 28:\n\nThe fel imps of Felspark Ravine in Hellfire are remarkably chatty. I've discovered that they're just as easy to contract into service as their names are to learn. The ritual to summon one is trivial, at best. Voidlords are rather difficult to stumble across, but it takes very little persuading to convince one to divulge the name of a rival lord.\n\nI have wondered once or twice if Kanrethad will ever return, but in the end, it doesn't actually matter. The council can put me to death, so long as my grimoires last, so will my legacy.\n\nDay 32:\n\nWhile examining the nauseating Ruins of Farahlon today in Netherstorm, I was ambushed by a race of floating eyeball squids. Calling themselves observers, they were unexpectedly intelligent. They expressed a deep desire to bear witness to all forms of magic and willingly offered their services in exchange for the opportunity to consume new forms of magic. The ritual to summon an observer is unexpectedly complex. While natives of the great dark beyond, they are highly migratory and the summoning ritual must compensate for their travels. Without their willing assistance, summoning an observer would be nearly impossible.\n\nDay 35:\n\nKanrethad returned, looking incredibly grim. Considering his undisciplined technique, it should be no surprise that his research has been less than successful.\n\nI'm ready to attempt the binding of a higher order member of the Burning Legion, but I dare not attempt the ritual alone. In fact, perhaps Kanrethad would prove the perfect test subject...\n\nDay 36:\n\nRemarkable! My first attempt to summon a higher order member of the legion failed as spectacularly as planned. The shivarra broke free almost instantly after Kanrethad completed the ritual. I expected the frail human to be struck down while I banished the creature. Instead, in the instant that the shivarra's razor-sharp blades sliced through the air, Kanrethad's form shifted and the blades bounced as if striking stone.\n\nUnlike the typical form of metamorphosis, he did not complete the demonic transformation... perhaps his research has been more successful than I expected.\n\nDay 40:\n\nThe key to binding a wrathguard was ironically reducing the number of runic symbols used in the summoning circle. Wrathguards are highly resistant to charms and compulsions, but readily respond to basic expressions of strength. Kanrethad was unexpectedly insightful into the conditioning the Legion uses to compel the wrathguard into action. His ability to express his dominance over lesser demons is remarkable, if short-lived. With great pains, I've been able to inscribe the forms he uses to summon multiple demonic servants at once. Unfortunately, while he can bind two lesser demons indefinitely, I can only do so for a short time.\n\nDay 47:\n\nWe left a few ogre corpses in our wake, but studying the ritual circle of Vim'gol revealed additional ways of bolstering our power using demonic sacrifices. While the act greatly enrages our demonic servants, fusing their life energy to our own provides a dramatic increase in power.\n\nWith a little experimentation, I discovered that the more closely linked you are with the demon you sacrifice, the greater the power of the ritual.\n\nKanrethad's ability to restrain his demonic transformation seems to have reached a plateau. Once again, his lack of power disgusts me. Things that would be trivial to most Warlocks take him an eternity.\n\nDay 50:\n\nAt Kanrethad's insistence, we headed for the Altar of Damnation in Shadowmoon Valley. He seems to be convinced that there's more to the Hand of Gul'dan than just a show of power.\n\nI'm not convinced, but at this point my grimoires are complete. I don't understand his obsession with controlling the flow of demonic power granted by his transformation. While he plays around with ancient altars, I intend to try my hand at opening a gateway to conjure many wild imps at once...\n\nDay 60:\n\nKanrethad is up to something. To say that I'm concerned about our next move is a dramatic understatement.\n\n(A ragged note is drawn onto the back cover of the leather journal)I'm convinced there is no chance that we will return from this next adventure alive. There's simply no way I can take the risk that my grimoires go unread. For that reason, I've contracted the imps to leave four fragments of my soulstone at the locations listed in my journal.\n\nI'm sending this journal to you, my trusted friend, that should the need to locate me arise, you bring the four stones together, find my body and ensure that my grimoires are brought back to Azeroth.\n\nSigned,\n\nJubeka Shadowbreaker", "authors": ["Jubeka Shadowbreaker "]}, {"id": "14098", "title": "Deathstalker Report", "text": "Deathstalker Mission Report\n\nAgents: Rane Yorick, Quinn Yorick, Erland McKree\n\nPrimary mission: perform reconnaissance through northern silverpine, and determine threat levels of wildlife and Scourge.\n\nAgents commenced sweep, finding significant worg presence.

Kil'jaeden surmised that he needed a new force to weaken Azeroth's defenses before the Legion even set foot upon the world. If the mortal races, such as the night elves and dragons, were forced to contend with a new threat, they would be too weak to pose any real resistance when the Legion's true invasion arrived.\n\nIt was at this time that Kil'jaeden discovered the lush world of Draenor floating peacefully within the Great Dark Beyond. Home to the shamanistic, clan-based orcs and the peaceful draenei, Draenor was as idyllic as it was vast.\n\nThe noble orc clans roamed the open prairies and hunted for sport, while the inquisitive draenei built crude cities within the world's towering cliffs and peaks. Kil'jaeden knew that Draenor's denizens had great potential to serve the Burning Legion if they could be cultivated properly.\n\nOf the two races, Kil'jaeden saw that the warrior orcs were more susceptible to the Legion's corruption. He enthralled the elder orc shaman, Ner'zhul, in much the same way that Sargeras brought Queen Azshara under his control in ages past. Using the cunning shaman as his conduit, the demon spread battle lust and savagery throughout the orc clans.\n\nBefore long, the spiritual race was transformed into a bloodthirsty people. Kil'jaeden then urged Ner'zhul and his people to take the last step: to give themselves over entirely to the pursuit of death and war. Yet the old shaman, sensing that his people would be enslaved to hatred forever, somehow resisted the demon's command.\n\nFrustrated by Ner'zhul's resistance, Kil'jaeden searched for another orc who would deliver his people into the Legion's hands. The clever demonlord finally found the willing disciple he sought - Ner'zhul's ambitious apprentice, Gul'dan. Kil'jaeden promised Gul'dan untold power in exchange for his utter obedience.\n\nThe young orc became an avid student of demonic magic and developed into the most powerful mortal warlock in history. He taught other young orcs the arcane arts and strove to eradicate the orcs' shamanistic traditions. Gul'dan showed a new brand of magic to his brethren, a terrible new power that reeked of doom.\n\nKil'jaeden, seeking to tighten his hold over the orcs, helped Gul'dan found the Shadow Council, a secretive sect that manipulated the clans and spread the use of warlock magics throughout Draenor. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade.

His indifference towards the politics of others does not mean he is complacent towards events that transpire throughout the world though.\n\nConsidered to be protectors, the bronze dragonflight find themselves greatly attracted to areas of civilization. The dragon and his flight are very patient by nature, always relying on observation and acting with a plan before being hasty. Nozdormu will always attempt to protect the time stream and the mortal races when threatened by greater enemies.\n\nNeltharion:\n\nNeltharion, called the Earth-Warder upon his creation, was more loyal and protective of Azeroth than any of the other Aspects. His black dragonflight were responsible for the creation of the mountains and the other formations of the lands including boundaries between the mortal races. What caused his corruption still remains a mystery; be it an outside influence or something that rotted from within. I wonder if perhaps the Old Gods didn't play a hand in the great black's corruption.\n\nThe black dragon underwent a complete transformation; and in the end, Neltharion no longer existed. He became Deathwing, a creature of malice and hatred. No longer the Earth-Warder in the eyes of races like the high elves, he was renamed the Death Aspect and Xaxas in place of his titan-given name. Deathwing is the embodiment of chaos and evil, and is always hungry for destruction.

Guarded by both the paladins and the veteran soldiers of the Alliance, the camps proved to be a great success.\n\nThough the captive orcs were tense and anxious to do battle once more, the various camp wardens, based at the old prison-fortress of Durnholde, kept the peace and maintained a strong semblance of order.\n\nHowever, on the hellish world of Draenor, a new orcish army prepared to strike at the unsuspecting Alliance. Ner'zhul, the former mentor of Gul'dan, rallied the remaining orc clans under his dark banner. Aided by the Shadowmoon clan, the old shaman planned to open a number of portals on Draenor that would lead the Horde to new, unspoiled worlds.\n\nTo power his new portals, he needed a number of enchanted artifacts from Azeroth. To procure them, Ner'zhul reopened the Dark Portal and sent his ravenous servants charging through it.\n\nThe new Horde, led by veteran chieftains such as Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye (of the Bleeding Hollow clan), surprised the Alliance defense forces and rampaged through the countryside. Under Ner'zhul's surgical command, the orcs quickly rounded up the artifacts that they needed and fled back to the safety of Draenor.\n\nKing Terenas of Lordaeron, convinced that the orcs were preparing a new invasion of Azeroth, assembled his most trusted lieutenants. He ordered General Turalyon and the archmage, Khadgar, to lead an expedition through the Dark Portal to put an end to the orcish threat once and for all. Turalyon and Khadgar's forces marched into Draenor and repeatedly clashed with Ner'zhul's clans upon the ravaged Hellfire Peninsula.\n\nEven with the aid of the high elf Alleria Windrunner, the dwarf Kurdran Wildhammer, and the veteran soldier Danath Trollbane, Khadgar was unable to prevent Ner'zhul from opening his portals to other worlds.\n\nNer'zhul finally opened his portals to other worlds, but he did not foresee the terrible price he would pay. The portals' tremendous energies began to tear the very fabric of Draenor apart. As Turalyon's forces fought desperately to return home to Azeroth, the world of Draenor began to buckle in upon itself. Grom Hellscream and Kilrogg Deadeye, realizing that Ner'zhul's mad plans would doom their entire race, rallied the remaining orcs and escaped back to the relative safety of Azeroth.\n\nOn Draenor, Turalyon and Khadgar agreed to make the ultimate sacrifice by destroying the Dark Portal from their side. Though it would cost their lives, and the lives of their companions, they knew that it was the only way to ensure Azeroth's survival.

She had no intention of allowing the Order of Tirisfal to manipulate her successor as they had tried to manipulate her. Traveling to the southern nation of Azeroth, Aegwynn found the perfect man to father her son: a skilled human magician known as Nielas Aran.\n\nAran was the court conjuror and advisor for Azeroth's king. Aegwynn seduced the magician and conceived a son by him. Nielas' natural affinity for magic would run deep within the unborn child and define the tragic steps the child would later take. The power of Tirisfal was also implanted in the child, yet it wasn't to awaken until he reached physical maturity.\n\nTime passed, and Aegwynn gave birth to her son in a secluded grove. Naming the boy Medivh, which means \"keeper of secrets\" in the high elven tongue, Aegwynn believed that the boy would mature to become the next Guardian. Unfortunately the malignant spirit of Sargeras, which had been hiding inside her, had possessed the defenseless child while it was still in her womb. Aegwynn had no idea that the world's newest Guardian was already possessed by its greatest nemesis.\n\nCertain that her baby was healthy and sound, Aegwynn delivered young Medivh to the court of Azeroth and left him there to be raised by his mortal father and his people. She then wandered into the wilderness and prepared to pass into whatever afterlife awaited her. Medivh grew to become a strong boy and had no idea of the potential power of his Tirisfalin birthright.\n\nSargeras bided his time until the youth's power manifested itself. By the time Medivh had reached his teenage years, he had become very popular in Azeroth for his magical prowess and often went off on adventures with his two friends: Llane, the prince of Azeroth, and Anduin Lothar, one of the last descendents of the Arathi bloodline. The three boys constantly caused mischief around the kingdom, but they were well liked by the general citizenry.\n\nWhen Medivh reached the age of fourteen, the cosmic power inside him awakened and clashed with the pervasive spirit of Sargeras that lurked within his soul.

The war had wounded each race deeply, but they had selflessly banded together to attempt a new beginning, starting with the uneasy truce between the Alliance and Horde.\n\nThrall led the orcs to the continent of Kalimdor, where they founded a new homeland with the help of their tauren brethren. Naming their new land Durotar after Thrall's murdered father, the orcs settled down to rebuild their once-glorious society.\n\nNow that the demon curse was ended, the Horde changed from a warlike juggernaut into more of a loose coalition, dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest.

That land mass, known as Kalimdor, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies.\n\nThe lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark beyond the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms.\n\nIn time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing, enchanted lake.\n\nThe feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant -children of the stars- in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake's periphery.\n\nThe Kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess, Elune, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored thebreadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens.\n\nThe only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful dragons. Thoughthe great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone.\n\nIn time, the night elves' curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was Cenarius, a mighty demi-god of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves and spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. The tranquil Kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.\n\nYet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted Queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls.\n\nHer servitors, whom she called the Quel'dorei or -high-borne,- doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.\n\nSharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world.\n\nThe high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery.\n\nAlthough they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.\n\nAs their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.\n\nA young, brazen scholar named Furion Stormrage, who had spent much of his time studying the Well's effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen.

Destroying the Frostwolf towers that sit near the front lines will cripple the Legionnaire and patrols that swarm the rear flank.\n\nThe towers are heavily fortified, each housing one of Drek'Thar's elite Commanders.

Though I was not born into their clan, they allowed me to fight alongside them and earn my place. In my prime, I stood side by side with their best hunters as we felled beasts that I had previously thought invincible. It is this togetherness that gives them strength.\n\nHowever, many Thunderlord speak legends of one of the earliest of the giant-slayers, who could fell these beasts single-handedly. Though their culture is greatly focused on synergy, there are still those who strive to become like these ancestors of legend. To this end, some of the most powerful in the clan will seek the weapon Gronnsbane, which is said to be the key to this power.\n\nAs I find myself growing longer in the years, I have found myself wondering if such a power exists. There are very few scholars among the Thunderlord, so I am taking it as a personal cause to unravel the mystery of Gronnsbane, so that it may be returned to its people.\n\nThe stories of Gronnsbane speak of the hero Brakor, who wielded Gronnsbane when the orcs were still enslaved by the ogres of Frostfire. It is said that the weapon was blessed by the elements of the land and its beasts, and that its power faded when it left Brakor's hands. Indeed, it seems that a weapon matching the description of Gronnsbane has been found many times since, but has never possessed this fabled power.\n\nIt is my belief that the weapon does not possess the power on its own, but that the aforementioned blessings are what give its potency.\n\nWhen speaking with the clan's shaman, I have uncovered more about these blessings. In the time of the Thunderlord's formation, just as the orcs began winning their freedom from the ogres, the ancient shaman were said to be granted their powers from powerful shamanstones. These stones granted the orcs with the blessings of frost and fire, which aided the Thunderlords in their liberation. These stones may be the key to the elemental blessings originally possessed by Gronnsbane.\n\nThe stones were left behind when the orcs fled their cruel enslavers, and it is believed that the ogres now use them to enhance their own magics.\n\nIn a recent raid against the Bloodmaul ogres, one of our warriors spotted what sounds to me like the Molten Shamanstone, which is said to offer the Blessing of Fire. He describes an ancient monolith, perched upon the edge of a precipice extending from the cliff where the searing magma falls into the sea. I believe the location he speaks of is just overlooking Tor'goroth's Tooth.\n\nI borrowed a rylak from one of our sky riders to scout the ogre camp myself. As I was maneuvering away from the great boulders hurled at me by the ogron brutes, I glanced what looked like another monolith atop the tallest of the snow-capped towers in Bloodmaul. Perhaps this is the Frozen Shamanstone, which is thought to grant the Blessing of Frost.\n\nIf these are indeed the sources of the ancient elemental blessings, then I may be very close to recovering the legacy of Gronnsbane. The last piece to unravel would be the blessing of beasts, which seems to be the final part of the enchantment.\n\nI believe that this enigmatic blessing of beasts may be tied to the legends around Brakor's first kill with Gronnsbane. It is said that Brakor proved his might by bloodying the spear against one of the ancient black rylaks that inhabit the tallest spires of the Stonefury Cliffs. The tales indicate that the weapon grew in power after that point, so the rylaks must be the final key!\n\nHigh in the Stonefury Cliffs, I have seen an altar where the ogres have left offerings to these ancient beasts. Perhaps I could use it to lure one of them down.\n\nIt seems that the pieces have come together, and I just may be able to recover Gronnsbane to its rightful home among the Thunderlord clan. Today I leave for Magnarok, which is the last known location of the weapon.

He uncovered a fossil today which the site scholars believe to be a bone fragment of an ancient god. Khazgorm is certain the fossil is part of a greater mystery. While he oversees the excavation site, he has made it my quest to discover more fossils to piece together the story. My assignment: head to the south in search of more clues.\n\n--Day Two--\n\nThe lands of the Barrens are vast and expansive. My trek has been long and arduous and has yielded nothing of interest for the Explorers' League archives so far. The only incident of note took place near the gold road. Off in the distance I noticed some strange creatures. Half pig, half man it seemed. I quickly hid and let the foul beasts pass. My what a foul stench they left behind!\n\n--Day Three--\n\nOh great and splendid discovery!\n\nWhilst exploring today I came across a grand find: massive remains of what seems to have been a boar-like creature. Its skull towered many lengths above me. Each tooth of the beast could dwarf even... well a dwarf. Due to the sheer size of the find, I am lead to believe these are the remains of one of the rumored Old Gods.\n\nA while back, at the Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, I remember a lecture given by Chief Archeologist Greywhisker. The old chap made mention of such a god, one which was revered by the strange elves of Darnassus because of his rumored altruistic nature--Bah! One moment. I hear snorting outside the tent. Surely just some thistle boars trying to get at my apple stash....\n\n--Day 4--\n\nCaptured!\n\nMust... write... quickly. Attacked by boar men of the Razorfen tribe. Believed they were taking me to the great boar remains of the fallen god. Instead, they skirted the great fossils and headed directly west of the giant skull, across the Gold Road.\n\nRoughly dragged inside of a foul-smelling, thorn infested bramble called Razorfen Kraul. Thrown inside a crudely crafted hut and held captive along with a dying night elf.\n\nNo possessions on me save for this journal, my quill and my pocket watch... Someone coming now...\n\n--Day 5--My night elf cell mate suffers from grave wounds. The boar men have whipped him repeatedly and I believe he will perish before long unless by some miracle a rescue party braves this treacherous place. He slips in and out of consciousness. When he awakes, I try to give him what little water I have.\n\nLast night he was able to speak for the first time. He is a druid, called Heralath, sent to these parts to examine the rumors of the fallen boar god. In a weakened voice he told me that he believed the great boar skull to be the place where the great boar god Agamaggan fell battling the Burning Legion some 10,\n\n000 years ago during the War of the Ancients. His massive body flattened the land and his blood sank into the earth. Twisted spires of thorns grow where his blood fell...\n\nHeralath and his people seek to discover the source of corruption at this site. Agamaggan was believed to be a pure god, he told me. Why these foul creatures and malignant thorns scar the land is a mystery indeed.\n\nBefore I could press for more information, Heralath slipped into fitful sleep once again...\n\n--Day 6--Heralath's condition worsens.\n\nHis eyes opened only once today. He spoke with pained anguish but his message was clear. If I were to escape my doom here in Razorfen Kraul, word must be gotten to Falfindel Waywarder in Thalanaar that Charlga Razorflank was rousing minions in the southern Barrens. The power grows with each day. The Crone must be stopped before the plague of corruption can spread from the Kraul.\n\nPoor Heralath looks pale as bone. His fever grows worse by the minute. All the while the boar men are preparing for some great military action. I fear that if I do not attempt my escape soon, I will meet a fate similar to my elven cell mate. My plan is to sneak out when the boar men leave for their next hunt. My guards are lazy and often sleep through their shifts.\n\nOnce free from the Kraul, I will head towards Thousand Needles and then west to Thalanaar on the border of the mysterious forest of Feralas. There I will seek the druid known as Falfindel Waywarder.\n\nWhat began as an attempt to explore the past of my people has turned into something much larger.

I put them in order of what I thought was easiest to hardest--I hope that makes it simpler for you.\n\nSome good whitestone oak - Before it was taken over, the mines below Moonbrook in Westfall had an abundance of the lumber; they used it in the construction of some of their more important lattices and tools because of its resilience to heat and pressure.\n\nIt was brought down there after being shipped from overseas somewhere. It's a rare wood that is plenty strong enough to be used in the crafting of your weapon. If any of it's left in the mines, then the goblin woodcarvers would have it.\n\nRefined Ore - There is a dwarf in Thelsamar, a smith that I trained with for some time, named Bailor Stonehand. He makes a very special alloy that I think would be perfect for your weapon. I expected a shipment of the alloy to arrive while I was in Ironforge, but I have yet to hear word from him.\n\nFind him and check on the shipment. And if he's no longer in Loch Modan, I would at least know what's happened to my old teacher.\n\nSmithing Hammer - Before the coming of the Plague and Arthas' betrayal, I lived in a town called Pyrewood, deep within the beautiful forest of Silverpine. The forest isn't nearly as beautiful as it once was, and the keep where I learned the secret of steel has long since become corrupt and foul, overrun with creatures of unimaginable evil.\n\nWhen my wife and I made our escape from what is now called Shadowfang Keep, we left some of our most precious possessions.\n\nAmong them, the smithing hammer my father gave me. I doubted it in my youth, but he always told me the hammer was enchanted, and it's the last reminder I had of him before he was killed by the Scourge.\n\nBring me my hammer, &lt;name&gt;, so I may use it as a focus for my passion. If it is indeed enchanted, then it will only aid us both.\n\nI left it in the stables in the main courtyard of the keep. Unless the creatures there have taken up smithing themselves, then I expect it to still be lying there.\n\nA Kor Gem - From the tales I've been told, the gems are used by some spell casters to hold energy for their magics, making them even deadlier. A night elf I once helped, Thundris Windweaver, can tell you more since you will be speaking on my behalf. I believe one of the gem's stored energies can be used in your weapon's creation.\n\nWhen last we spoke, Thundris was in Auberdine a town deep within Darkshore, the corrupted forest that dots the coast underneath the shadow of the night elf homeland.", "authors": ["Jordan "]}, {"id": "14213", "title": "The Birth of the Lich King", "text": "Ner'zhul and his followers entered the Twisting Nether, the ethereal plane that connects all of the worlds scattered throughout the Great Dark Beyond. Unfortunately Kil'jaeden and his demonic minions were waiting for them. Kil'jaeden, who had sworn to take vengeance on Ner'zhul for his prideful defiance, slowly tore the old shaman's body apart, piece by piece.\n\nKil'jaeden kept the shaman's spirit alive and intact, thus leaving Ner'zhul painfully aware of his body's gross dismemberment. Though Ner'zhul pleaded with the demon to release his spirit and grant him death, the demon grimly replied that the Blood Pact they had made long ago was still binding, and that Ner'zhul still had a purpose to serve.\n\nThe orcs' failure to conquer the world for the Burning Legion forced Kil'jaeden to create a new army to sow chaos throughout the kingdoms of Azeroth. This new army could not be allowed to fall prey to the same petty rivalries and infighting that had plagued the Horde. It would have to be merciless and single-minded in its mission. This time, Kil'jaeden could not afford to fail.\n\nHolding Ner'zhul's spirit helpless in stasis, Kil'jaeden gave him one last chance to serve the Legion or suffer eternal torment. Once again, Ner'zhul recklessly agreed to the demon's pact. Ner'zhul's spirit was placed within a specially crafted block of diamond-hard ice gathered from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether.\n\nEncased within the frozen cask, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand-fold. Warped by the demon's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul became a spectral being of unfathomable power. At that moment, the orc known as Ner'zhul was shattered forever, and the Lich King was born.\n\nNer'zhul's loyal death knights and Shadowmoon followers were also transformed by the demon's chaotic energies. The wicked spellcasters were ripped apart and remade as skeletal liches. The demons had ensured that even in death, Ner'zhul's followers would serve him unquestioningly.\n\nWhen the time was right, Kil'jaeden explained the mission for which he had created the Lich King. Ner'zhul was to spread a plague of death and terror across Azeroth that would snuff out human civilization forever. All those who died from the dreaded plague would arise as the undead, and their spirits would be bound to Ner'zhul's iron will forever.\n\nKil'jaeden promised that if Ner'zhul accomplished his dark mission of scouring humanity from the world, he would be freed from his curse and granted a new, healthy body to inhabit.\n\nThough Ner'zhul was agreeable and seemingly anxious to play his part, Kil'jaeden remained skeptical of his pawn's loyalties. Keeping the Lich King bodiless and trapped within the crystal cask assured his good conduct for the short term, but the demon knew that he would need to keep a watchful eye on him. To this end, Kil'jaeden called upon his elite demon guard, the vampiric dreadlords, to police Ner'zhul and ensure that he accomplished his dread task.\n\nTichondrius, the most powerful and cunning of the dreadlords, warmed to the challenge; he was fascinated by the plague's severity and the Lich King's unbridled potential for genocide.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14214", "title": "Secret Note #1", "text": "Agasham,\n\nOur plans must be kept secret at all costs!

Could it be true...\n\nDay 19\n\nWe knew our time was limited. We evacuated everyone that we could, but Burnside stated that he would go down with Hillsbrad. We all agreed to stand by his side.\n\nMagistrate Burnside, Citizen Wilkes, Blacksmith Verringtan and the farmers, Getz, Kalaba and Ray remain here as well as a few dozen farmhands.\n\nDay 20\n\nThe Hillsbrad Fields are no more. Those that did not flee were captured. The Forsaken have declared us as prisoners of war. We are to be laborers at their new plantation.\n\nDay 25\n\nThey incinerated our farms and made us watch. Construction begins tomorrow.\n\nDay 40\n\nConstruction of their plantation is nearly complete. This place resembles no farm or plantation that I've ever seen.\n\nDay 41\n\nThe warden of the plantation, Stillwater, arrived today. He lined all of us up and gave us medical examinations. Nobody knows what's going on.\n\nDay 45\n\nWe've started laboring in the sludge fields. They grow poisonous mushrooms in fetid water and muck.\n\nDay 50\n\nI hear screams coming from the Warden's manor.

From what little information I am able to gather he is here to supervise the operations. Lydon is his name.\n\nDay 62\n\nMaster Apothecary Lydon was dragged away by Stillwater's guards. He was yelling and screaming that the Dark Lady would have Stillwater's head for this. What is he talking about, I wonder?\n\nDay 63\n\nI saw them take away Burnside and Verringtan last night.

The events that brought downfall of Lordaeron were long set in motion before that point; it began with the coming of the orcish clans and the Burning Legion.\n\nThe orcs of Draenor (the world which they originally came from) were noble and shamanistic. They were powerful warriors, strong of body and will. It was for these reasons that the Burning Legion sought them out. Kil'jaeden, a demon of great power among the Legion, wished to enslave the orcish clans and use them as his army against the worlds the Burning Legion had yet to conquer.\n\nKil'jaeden came to the leader of the clans, a powerful shaman named Ner'zhul. He promised Ner'zhul untold mystical power and knowledge if he made a pact with the demon that would enslave the clans to the Burning Legion. This pact sealed not only their fate, but that of their world forever.\n\nAs time passed, Ner'zhul realized the fate of the clans at the hands of the Burning Legion, and the orc shaman began to defy Kil'jaeden. The demon, angered by Ner'zhul, turned to the shaman's own apprentice, Gul'dan, who was far more corruptible than Ner'zhul.\n\nIt was Gul'dan who was responsible for the decline of shamanism throughout the clans. The promise of power and control over one's enemies made his offers even more tempting. With Kil'jaeden's help, Gul'dan began his manipulation of the clans. The orcs, once noble, became corrupt, mindless savages. With the introduction of demon blood into their bodies, the orcs were even more ruthless and barbaric.\n\nEven though Kil'jaeden had corrupted Gul'dan after his failure with Ner'zhul, Kil'jaeden hated the shaman and vowed to enforce their original pact. Kil'jaeden captured Ner'zhul and began an incredibly slow physical torture on the shaman. While Ner'zhul begged for death, Kil'jaeden reminded Ner'zhul that their original pact was still binding. Kil'jaeden killed the orc, but only physically. Kil'jaeden held the orc shaman's spirit fast before it could find its way to the Twisting Nether.\n\nKil'jaeden placed Ner'zhul's spirit within a block of ice gathered from the Twisting Nether. While it was trapped within the ice, he infused into it even more power. The loss of his body and the introduction of such incredible power was the defining line in Ner'zhul's transformation.\n\nKil'jaeden hurled the block of ice through dimensions back to Azeroth, where it landed in the continent of Northrend, introducing this great evil to our world. Ner'zhul was gone forever; in his place was a throne of ice and hatred. The once respected shaman leader had become the incredibly powerful Lich King.\n\nBecause Kil'jaeden did not trust the Lich King, he sent his dread lords to watch over the spirit and ensure that the Lich King followed his orders. The vampiric servants came to Azeroth willingly, drawn to the destruction and power of the Lich King and the potential genocide of a planet's entire race.\n\nOver a decade passed. During this time, the Lich King used his vast powers to gain control over the minds of the creatures of Northrend, whom he commanded to erect a great citadel over his frozen throne. Now that all of Northrend was under his domination, the Lich King knew he needed to begin his infiltration of Lordaeron. Trapped within the ice, the former orc shaman began seeking more minds to manipulate and control. His call reached out across the continents.\n\nThe Lich King's summons did not go unnoticed, especially by a small handful of powerful individuals. Among them was the Archmage Kel'Thuzad, who was a powerful member of the ruling body of Dalaran, the Kirin Tor. His pursuit of all types of magic violated the Kirin Tor's policies against learning dark magics. Kel'Thuzad abandoned the Kirin Tor and all his ties to conventional thought and vowed to learn as much as he could from the Lich King.\n\nA pact was struck between the two. Kel'Thuzad would receive immortality and immense power in return for servitude to the Lich King. Kel'Thuzad's first task was to use his wealth and influence in Lordaeron to found the Cult of the Damned. The Cult promised equality and eternal life to all its members as long as they swore an oath to Ner'zhul, the 'god' of the Cult of the Damned.\n\nNer'zhul then created artifacts that were designed to spread the plague among the human civilizations of Lordaeron. He gave them to Kel'Thuzad, and ordered the wizard to spread them across the land. His Cult followers were to protect the artifacts at all costs.\n\nOnce in place, the plague began to seep into the land and affect its ignorant citizens. As Kel'Thuzad watched, the Lich King's army grew quickly and he soon gained control over large portions of the land.

Yet while my shan'do spouted this freedom, he disgraced me and my fellow druids of the pack by banning our form. I can still recall with great clarity his angry tirades whenever he discovered us practicing in secret.\n\n\"The pack form cannot be controlled. It will consume you, and endanger us all.\"\n\nThe ignorance with which Malfurion passed judgment on us is infuriating. Does he not realize that the spirit of the wolf ancient, Goldrinn, is by nature's grace within me and my pack brethren? We did not choose it. It chose us. To shun it would be to turn our backs on nature itself.\n\nIt only pains me that at a time like this, when our race is threatened by war with the vile satyr, Malfurion rejects us -- the very druids who could turn the tide of battle in his favor.\n\nIt matters little now. Today my brethren and I will depart from night elf society forever to begin life anew in the wild. We will show our shan'do's beliefs to be wrong and prove that Goldrinn's spirit can in fact be controlled.\n\nDay 7\n\nSix nights have come and gone since we carved out our new homes in the heart of the forest. Our pack leader, Renthel, has taken charge over the community, and under his wise leadership I have at last found true freedom.\n\nEach night we practice our form at the roots of a fallen tree where we have placed Goldrinn's fang. A thing of beauty it is... merely being in its presence seems to empower me. At times I wonder if the wolf ancient left this remnant of himself on the world as a gift to those who pursue his form.\n\nThese nightly sessions have filled me with renewed confidence in my ability to harness Goldrinn's spirit. Although Malfurion so often spoke of its dangers, even now we are proving him to be wrong.\n\nDay 12\n\nThere was an argument tonight. A seasoned druid named Thaldrus laid claim to leadership of the pack over Renthel, and both druids settled the dispute in pack form. They circled one another for what seemed an eternity, mouths foaming and fangs bared, until Thaldrus lunged at Renthel and pinned him to the ground.\n\nRenthel honorably accepted his defeat and relinquished his leadership with no further violence. If only Malfurion could have witnessed the dignity with which Thaldrus and Renthel acted on this eve.\n\nDay 23\n\nSomething strange has been happening of late. My brothers spend more and more time in pack form throughout the day. Many of them claim that it is a necessity to mastering the form, yet I feel that is not the sole reason.\n\nAn urge, primal in origin, grows inside of me. It is a desire that I can only sufficiently sate when I take on the pack form. I fear that the others feel it too.\n\nDay 28\n\nTonight, under the two moons, we ventured through the wild in pack form and felled three stags. So famished were my brethren and I that we simply ripped into the creatures, clawing and biting at each other while we feasted. Euphoria washed over me as I sank my teeth into the stag's raw flesh. Even if I had been without an appetite, gorging on the creature would have satisfied me.\n\nDay 38\n\nFirst time out of pack form in seven nights. Live as a wolf like others, from one night to next. Pack leader Thaldrus says night elf bodies are weak. All trust him. All follow him. If he saw me now, he would kill me.\n\nGoldrinn's spirit consuming us. Fighting it feels just as wrong as giving in.\n\nDay 42\n\nStill taste pack leader Thaldrus' blood in my mouth. Cannot recall details. Only remember Thaldrus taking Goldrinn's fang from fallen tree. Caught him dragging it into his den and--&lt;This part of the page is illegible due to blood stains&gt;Took two nights for Thaldrus to come out. We were waiting. Fangs and claws and rage. Tore him apart. Fur and flesh everywhere. Only gnawed bones afterward.\n\nNo leader now.\n\nDay 52\n\nMuch has come to pass of late, and I feel that at last I have regained a portion of my sanity. Five nights ago, I left my den to discover that the other pack members were gathered around something, or as I soon discovered, someone. A night elf whose scent I recognized as Ralaar Fangfire, a druid of Malfurion's ilk.\n\nAs one we encircled him, yet the intruder held his ground. I smelled not a hint of fear on him, despite the fact that he remained in night elf form. His arrogance was quite infuriating.\n\nThree of my enraged brothers charged Ralaar, and the newcomer took on the pack form and bested the challengers with little effort... yet he did not kill them.\n\nIn that instant I became aware of a difference between him and us. We had become savages... scarred, lean, and disheveled. Ralaar, however, was powerful, majestic, and still rife with Goldrinn's essence.\n\nWhen no others dared challenge him, Ralaar took on his night elf form and spoke. In a tirade that reminded me of Malfurion, he berated us for becoming mindless animals and squandering what he referred to as the purity of Goldrinn's essence. Yet unlike my former shan'do, Ralaar also promised to teach us the true path to harnessing the wolf ancient's spirit. I sensed tremendous rage in his voice, tempered by a self control that I had somehow lost in recent weeks.\n\nOne by one we all left our pack forms. I can only guess that my brethren, like I, felt a strange affinity to this newcomer, as if he were a messenger of Goldrinn himself. Ralaar has since begun teaching us as he had promised, though he no longer answers to his given name.\n\nRather, he now refers to himself simply as Alpha Prime.\n\n-Gaedrin Moonfang, Druid of the Pack", "authors": ["Gaedrin Moonfang "]}, {"id": "14242", "title": "Solomon's Plea to Darkshire", "text": "Lord Ebonlocke--\n\nThe Township of Lakeshire humbly requests the aid of the Night Watch.

At last! After all of my years of prayers and good deeds, the cleansing of the blight of the unliving from the face of Azeroth. After all of the failures and resurrections.\n\nFinally!\n\nIt happened again. \"Come to me...\", the Light commanded.\n\nI woke up freezing, but it wasn't cold in my chambers. I'm going to redouble my efforts! I'll tell the high abbot tomorrow that I want prayers increased. No more half-measures!\n\nThe Holy Light has taken notice of our good work. I can feel it!\n\nThis time I was awake! It was very vivid, and yet for over a minute, in the middle of the warm, sunny day, my breath came out misted and chill. One of the priests noticed and dropped to his knees in prayer.\n\nNo one else heard the voice, though. At least the witness proves that I'm not going insane. Maybe I should ask Landgren to pray on the matter?I'll get Jordan and Street to scrutinize their recruiting efforts tomorrow. We've grown bloated with ranks of unbelievers who yearn only to destroy the undead. That's not enough!\n\nThe commander and the bishop were both receptive. Not that they had any choice. Bishop Street in particular seemed very enthusiastic. He spoke of a revival for the crusade and swore to ferret out the weak of faith within our ranks.\n\nI told him to go easy. I've no intention of destroying the Crusade. However, I do like the sound of forming an elite cadre of the most faithful to do the Light's bidding in Northrend. I fear the man's friendship with Le\n\nCraft is slowly twisting him. They both have their uses, though.\n\nI will leave most of the Crusade here to continue mopping-up operations on the undead in our backyard. I imagine that once they have finished what we began, most will disband and go back to their homes to live in peace.\n\nThat somehow seems right. At our finest, we have always been the salt of the earth, rising up to take back our homes from the filth of the Scourge corruption, to return our Lordaeron to its former glory. To a time before the Scourge, before Arthas and regicide... before the Lich King.\n\nThere have been whispers amongst the men about a day soon to come that will change everything for the Scarlet Crusade. Bishop Street has put a name to it, calling it the Crimson Dawn.\n\nI will put some thought to this, though I can feel the truth of it in my bones. I pray that it will bring weal for us rather than woe.\n\nThe Light has spoken again with a great deal of urgency. I came away from the dream with a sense of impatience. I will not disappoint. There must be no more delays. We must soon be underway!\n\nWhat a great coincidence then - and I had to control myself from showing my relief - this afternoon Captain Shely procured for us a number of new ships for the voyage. Perhaps it was no coincidence at all? The Holy Light expresses its will in ways that we are not meant to understand.\n\nI will take the Sinner's Folly as my flag. I think the name is most fitting.\n\nNow I know why the Light has been pushing me to be underway. In the dead of night a Scourge necropolis appeared in the sky over us and out poured the minions of hell!\n\nA new breed of death knight leads the assault. Already the casualties we've suffered have been catastrophic. With the Scourge able to strike at us anywhere and at will from above, there seems no way to mount a proper defense.\n\nI fear that our intended expedition to Northrend is over before it has begun.\n\nI've been informed that Hearthglen and the surrounding area have already begun to assemble a host. High Commander Galvar Pureblood himself intends to lead them to save us. His efforts will be for naught.\n\nI must see to it that my best couriers get through the enemy lines and warn him off. Hearthglen must prepare to dig in and rally the rest of the Crusade.\n\nWith any luck they'll get through before nightfall.\n\nThere's been no word from any of my couriers this morning. It's clear that none of them made it through to Hearthglen. The Plaguelands are lost. Pureblood will come with his forces and they'll be annihilated out in the open.\n\nThis afternoon I received a vision from the Light. In it, I saw the utter destruction of everything that we've built here. The message was clear - I was being told to take the remainder of the most faithful and abandon the Crusade to their doom.\n\nLandgren later told me that he'd received the same vision. I cannot comprehend how the Light would tell us to take such a dishonorable action, but it is not my place to question - I am to obey, and obey I shall.\n\nIt was with trepidation that I gazed upon New Avalon, I suspect for the last time. Our fate lies in Northrend. I am filled with a sense of ominous foreboding for some reason. The mission ahead should shake away these concerns. I will put them out of my mind.\n\nPerhaps with luck, High Commander Pureblood will somehow endure and marshal the survivors. I'm a coward - a dog running away with my tail tucked between my legs!\n\nTwo months they tell me that this journey is going to take. The other ships aren't built for speed like the Folly. They're carrying most of our forces and equipment, and they're not much more than single sail freighters, but they'll get there safely.\n\nI'm not looking forward to this, but for the Light I will endure the sea sickness. I simply mustn't let the others see.\n\nI've not written in a while. It's as much as I can do to stand upright and not get sick. The men are beginning to wonder why I keep myself holed up in my cabin most of the time. It wouldn't be good for morale for them to see me this way.\n\nIt shouldn't be long now. I pray that it won't be. Six weeks already and every day it seems that the weather gets worse. I can only hope that Northrend itself does not have such horrible weather. I wasn't built for the cold.\n\nThe Holy Light has been silent for a very long time.\n\nWe were attacked with no warning whatsoever! Giants in massive oared longships came out of the mist like ghosts! They were silent as the dead.\n\nI lost a ship and all of the men on it. We fought with great courage and skill considering that we have only the most rudimentary naval combat training.\n\nAfterward, the screams of our men who'd been taken captive by the giants echoed across the water. After a while it grew silent again. Bishop Street led the men in prayers.\n\nI awoke this morning in the middle of making adjustments to my maps. The Light was guiding my hand, showing me exactly where we must go.\n\nWe are close!\n\nLandfall!\n\nExiting the rowboat upon the beach, I planted our banner and was overcome by the Holy Light, which spoke through me. Today is the Crimson Dawn - the great day that we've waited for. This is to be the site of New Hearthglen. We are no longer the Scarlet Crusade. We are now the Scarlet Onslaught!\n\nAnd an onslaught upon Northrend we shall be! The cancer of the Scourge threatens to overflow in the crown of the world and drown the rest of us. The time has come to take the fight directly to the Lich King's doorstep!\n\nIt's been almost a month now and construction has proceeded apace. I've been too busy to write. My scouts tell me that this land is full of dragons and other strange beasts. We'll keep to ourselves until we're ready.\n\nIn the middle of services today, the high abbot proclaimed that a visitor would arrive soon - one that the Light was sending to lead us to victory.\n\nI don't know how I feel about that. Why didn't the Light tell me? Have I not served faithfully? Now I'm to be replaced by some outsider?\n\nAdmiral Barean Westwind showed up on my doorstep tonight! By all accounts he'd died upon these shores an age ago.\n\nHe didn't look old enough and yet I knew that it was him. He claimed that he was the only survivor of his doomed fleet and that he'd survived only through the good graces of the Light.\n\nWe stayed up speaking through the night and into the morning. He assured me that he had no intention of taking my place, but that the Light had instructed him to travel across the Great Dragonblight to serve as my advisor and commander in title only. He claimed that great change was coming to Northrend. The Alliance and the Horde were going to come en masse in response to a great plague that the Lich King was about to unleash upon them.\n\nThe men have taken to the grand admiral with great zeal, especially High Abbot Landgren and Bishop Street. Apparently the Holy Light whispered a new blessing to the admiral in his sleep, which he passed on to Landgren. Some of the men have converted to the priesthood and are now being called \"raven priests\".Only Jordan seems unimpressed. I suppose that's understandable. He probably feels his position is threatened if mine is.\n\nSomething doesn't seem right. I can't put my finger on it, but I cannot make myself fully trust the admiral. He's done nothing wrong. Quite the contrary! And yet, I have to trust my gut.\n\nI will pray for understanding. The Light delivered the admiral to lead us to victory and it is not my place to question its decisions. I will continue to obey. I am faithful.\n\nAnother couple of months have passed. We've made great strides in the construction of New Hearthglen. The wall is almost complete as is the barracks. Kaleiki's men are miracle workers.\n\nMy heart hasn't been into writing. I've been avoiding putting my thoughts here for some reason. The Light hasn't visited me of late, though the admiral assures me that this is nothing to worry about.\n\nMy men report that a small group of Forsaken have broken ground on a camp along the hillside to the north. On the other side of the hill, the Alliance have apparently begun the construction of a much larger base.\n\nThe admiral says that we should leave them be. There are other Horde forces gathered to the west that would surely come to their aid if we were to attack. I don't feel good about it, but I see the logic in his reasoning.\n\nThe first phase of construction is done. Admiral Westwind has ordered a group of my men to establish a toehold further to the north. He wouldn't go into detail, claiming that he was being \"guided\" to do so.\n\nWe caught four spies from the Forsaken town, Venomspite, this afternoon.

Malfurion, who had become an arch-druid of immense power, greeted the mighty dragons and told them about the creation of the new Well of Eternity.\n\nThe great dragons were alarmed to hear the dark news and speculated that as long as the Well remained, the Legion might one day return and assault the world once again. Malfurion and the three dragons made a pact to keep the Well safe and ensure that the agents of the Burning Legion would never find their way back into the world.\n\nAlexstrasza, the Lifebinder, placed a single, enchanted acorn within the heart of the Well of Eternity. The acorn, activated by the potent, magical waters, sprung to life as a colossal tree. The mighty tree's roots grew from the Well's waters, and its verdant canopy seemed to scrape the roof of the sky.\n\nThe immense tree would be an everlasting symbol of the night elves' bond with nature, and its life-giving energies would extend out to heal the rest of the world over time.

They were much in love with each other and would eventually produce three children, a son and two daughters.\n\nMorgan was thirty-two when war broke out in Lordaeron. Morgan was called to the side of the legendary paladin Uther the Lightbringer to fight against the orcs and the undead. Leaving his wife and children in the safety of his home, Morgan left for war.\n\nThe years passed and the war dragged on, and Morgan would witness many horrific events, including the disbanding of the Paladins of the Silver Hand, the death of Uther and the spread of the plague. The only thing that kept him from the brink of madness was the knowledge that he would someday be reunited with his wife and children.\n\nMorgan would eventually return to his homeland, but find it nothing like how he remembered it. The once verdant forest was corrupted and teemed with the undead and other dark forces. Destroyed houses and farms could be found everywhere, and the cemetery near Raven Hill now dominated much of the area. A shocked and bewildered Morgan eventually made his way to his home, only to find it in ruins. Not knowing what had befallen his homeland, he headed towards the village to find answers, and, he hoped, his wife and children.\n\nMorgan inquired about his family, but could not find any answers. A priest in Darkshire, as it was now called, said that he might search the cemetery at Raven Hill for a gravestone. Morgan refused to believe that his family was dead, and continued to search every farm and house in Duskwood, but to no avail.\n\nMorgan rode from Darkshire to nearby Lakeshire, thinking that perhaps his family had fled. On his way there, he decided, against his better judgment, to stop by the Raven Hill cemetery. Morgan spent hours walking amongst the gravestones. He recognized many names of people that he knew and became more and more distraught. Then he saw them: a small, untended plot amongst the many with three small gravestones. A feeling of dread washed over him as he approached. Morgan brushed off the dust of the most prominent gravestone to reveal the name on it. Simply carved upon the grave, letters spelled out his worst fear:\n\nLys Ladimore\n\nBeloved Wife and Mother\n\nMorgan's apprehension turned to dismay and then to grief, and he fell to his knees weeping. For hours he stared at that one grave, begging the cold stone for forgiveness and sobbing apologies. Then, hours later, something in him snapped, and he began to lash out. He brought his sword out of its scabbard and began to rain blows on the gravestones, screaming in rage. Blind in his fury, he lashed out and swung wildly, catching the notice of a trio of the cemetery's attendants. As they tried to restrain him, he turned his focus to them, hurling accusations of guilt upon the innocent attendants, then killed them all.\n\nLater, when the rage had passed, realization crept into Morgan's mind, and he saw his bloody sword driven into the chest of one of the attendants. Driven to the brink by his emotions, he removed his belt knife and plunged it into his heart.\n\nMorgan Ladimore's body and the three bodies of his victims were found the next day. He was quickly buried, without ceremony, in a hastily dug grave on the outskirts of the cemetery. Because Morgan committed murder against innocents, something that went completely against his beliefs and his nature, and because of the grief that he held in being unable to save his family, Morgan could not die a peaceful death, and lived on as one of the restless dead.\n\nOnly days later, his grave was disturbed, and his body could not be found. The being that was Morgan now wanders Duskwood, consumed by his grief over the loss of his wife and children and his own self-hatred. Mor'Ladim, as he now calls himself, roams Duskwood with mindless vengeance and hatred, and has been known to commit murder indiscriminately.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14267", "title": "Secret Note #3", "text": "Agasham,\n\nOur agents from Lordaeron will meet with your delegates, soon.

His skin may be rotting and blood may have long stopped flowing through his veins, but he acts very nobly and seems to care more for his compatriots' safety than his own.\n\nIndeed, there is a humanity within him that, I confess, I sometimes see lacking in the humans around me.\n\nBut why do I mention this? I do so to give credence to what I am about to write, for these words came from Kegan's lips and it is my hope that my colleagues will, upon reading this journal, know why I believe what he said:\"Remnants of the Old Gods still linger in the deep hollows of the world. New forces seek to harness that ancient power, and those who succeed will have a terrible weapon against their enemies.\"\n\nThat is what Kegan uttered as he handed his bloodstone pendant to me, and there was fear, and maybe reverence, in his eyes as he did so. And as his hands met with mine they lingered, as if reluctant to give up the pendant. Revulsion swept through me, yet to this day I know not if I reviled against his dead flesh pressed to mine, or if the pendant itself made my skin crawl.\n\nFor I felt a power within it. A deep, hidden, hungry power. And one yearning for release.\n\nAlthough my colleagues in Dalaran were cautious to study the bloodstones that Kegan and his followers brought with them, instead quarantining the four refugees and leaving the bloodstones on their persons, the sincerity of Kegan obliged me to study his bloodstone pendant.\n\nMy hopes were to verify for my colleagues that this type of stone did possess magical properties, and if we wizards of Dalaran did not wish to exploit the power of bloodstones, we should at the least learn their properties, since our foes may one day use them against us.\n\nAnd so my studies began.\n\nI started my tests with the assumption that bloodstone was a type of rock, like quartz or obsidian. So I began a series of procedures to determine: what minerals were contained within bloodstone, what forces were applied to produce its color and hardness, and other properties common to rocks and ore. But the bloodstone pendant, to my frustration, did not react to my procedures as would normal ore.\n\nIn fact, it often acted in precisely the opposite fashion as expected! It was almost as if the pendant was deliberately fouling my experiments.\n\nLike it was thinking, and alive.\n\nAngered but not discouraged, I switched from assuming the pendant was an inert piece of rock, to assuming it was a living thing. But again, I failed.\n\nNone of my new tests brought to light any revelations of the origin of bloodstone. At the time the only riddle I solved was that bloodstone was neither living, nor dead!\n\nBut it was then, at the brink of failure, that a breakthrough was made. My latest test involved a glass beaker whose brim was chipped, leaving a small, jagged space along its edge. When the test was over, again revealing nothing, I went to clean my worktable and cut myself on the beaker.\n\nThe cut was not deep but nevertheless bled fiercely. Before I could wrap my injured finger in a bandage, a good deal of my blood had spilled on my worktable.\n\nAnd as I was cleaning up this new mess, I noticed the strangest thing...\n\nThe blood that had spilled near the bloodstone pendant was slowly moving toward the piece of jewelry, as if gravity had somehow bent itself toward the bloodstone. The blood that touched the pendant seemed to disappear, and the red color of the stone deepened as it drank more of my blood.\n\nAfter seeing this my head grew light, perhaps from my recent injury (though I did not believe I had lost that much blood) or perhaps because I had finally, after so much frustration, uncovered one of the bloodstone's properties. I reached behind me for my work stool and sat down, pondering. Thoughts and questions raced through my head, dizzying and threatening to topple me. Does bloodstone drink blood? Does it crave blood? Does it attract blood?\n\nOr, is bloodstone made of blood? And if so, then whose blood? Mine? The blood of any human? Any animal? Or maybe bloodstone is the blood of some unknown thing, the very thing that Kegan had both feared and revered when he handed me his pendant.\n\nThat is the question that must be answered. It is the key.\n\nFire rekindled within me, I then dove back into my experiments. This time I made no assumptions, methodically performing every test at my disposal. This increased my required efforts tremendously, but I would be more likely to make discoveries. And, although my lab here is small and I have no subordinates to spare to aid, I did find one more intriguing quality of bloodstone...\n\nIn addition to blood, there are elemental forces fused within the stone. Fire, water, thunder and rock are mixed with the blood (but again, the blood of what?), and although this mixture is outwardly inert, all these forces seem to rage inwardly against each other. So many more questions were then raised about this amazing, and foreboding material.\n\nBut to answer those questions, more studies and experiments must be performed on the pendant, and I fear that the Lordamere Interment Camp cannot marshal the manpower nor the equipment for the task. So I sent the bloodstone pendant with a courier to Dalaran with specific instructions on how to test it, so they may avoid my earlier frustrations.\n\nAs I waited for the results of these tests, I spent my time speaking to Kegan. Although I constantly pressed him for what he knew about bloodstones, he never told me more than what he said the day he gave me his pendant. And he did not often speak of his time within the fold of what he called \"the Forsaken,\" which is the name he calls his clan of undead.\n\nBut Kegan was very eager to speak on other subjects, particularly his time growing up in Lordaeron before its fall. He still holds much love for that lost kingdom, even though it is now ruined, and dead.\n\nMy growing fondness for Kegan gave me patience as I waited for my test results.\n\nBut after weeks of no news my patience faltered, and upon further inquires to Dalaran I learned that the bloodstone never reached my colleagues. My courier was somehow lost on the way, and the bloodstone pendant was lost with him!\n\nThis is grave news, for although Kegan and his followers still have bloodstone specimens with which we may experiment, I fear the pendant may fall into unsavory hands.\n\nI have sent another messenger to Dalaran, and hear that even now they are scouring for the pendant, in the ruins outside our protective sphere.\n\nI only hope we're not too late.", "authors": ["Warden Belamoore "]}, {"id": "14271", "title": "Kravel's Parts Order", "text": "ORDER NUMBER: 45TK-3\n\nBUYER: Kravel Koalbeard\n\nINVOICE:\n\nHydro Ratchet (3)\nRepeater Bolts (50)\n30\" 20-gauge copper tubing (12)\nSnuff, Deepfury brand (1)\nHigh-grade prism (3)", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14272", "title": "A Steamy Romance Novel: Blue Moon", "text": "Tail swooshing and hips swaying, the curvy figure walked purposefully across the lake toward the man resting by the shore; rising quickly as she approached, he appeared visibly happy to be in her presence.

Their fleets wandered the wreckage of the world for many long years, and they discovered mysteries and lost kingdoms along their sojourn. Dath'Remar, who had taken the name Sunstrider (or \"he who walks the day\"), sought out places of considerable ley power upon which to build a new homeland for his people.\n\nHis fleet finally landed on the beaches of the kingdom men would later call Lordaeron. Forging inland, the high elves founded a settlement within the tranquil Tirisfal Glades. After a few years, many of them began to go mad. It was theorized that something evil slept beneath that particular part of the world, but the rumors were never proven to be true. The high elves packed up their encampment and moved northward towards another land rich with ley energies.\n\nAs the high elves crossed the rugged, mountainous lands of Lordaeron, their journey became more perilous. Since they were effectively cut off from the life-giving energies of the Well of Eternity, many of them fell ill from the frigid climate or died from starvation. The most disconcerting change, however, was the fact that they were no longer immortal or immune to the elements.\n\nThey also shrank somewhat in height, and their skin lost its characteristic violet hue. Despite their hardships, they encountered many wondrous creatures that had never been seen in Kalimdor. They also found tribes of primitive humans who hunted throughout the ancient forestlands. However, the direst threat they encountered were the voracious and cunning forest trolls of Zul'Aman.\n\nThese moss-skinned trolls could regenerate lost limbs and heal grievous physical injuries, but they proved to be a barbaric, evil race. The Amani empire stretched across most of northern Lordaeron, and the trolls fought hard to keep unwanted strangers from their borders. The elves developed a deep loathing for the vicious trolls and killed them on sight whenever they were encountered.\n\nAfter many long years, the high elves finally found a land which was reminiscent of Kalimdor. Deep within the northern forests of the continent, they founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and vowed to create a mighty empire which would dwarf that of their Kaldorei cousins. Unfortunately they soon learned that Quel'Thalas was founded upon an ancient troll city that the trolls still held to be sacred. Almost immediately, the trolls began to attack the elven settlements en masse.\n\nThe stubborn elves, unwilling to give up their new land, utilized the magics which they had gleaned from the Well of Eternity and kept the savage trolls at bay. Under Dath'Remar's leadership, they were able to defeat the Amani warbands that outnumbered them ten to one. Some elves, wary of the Kaldorei's ancient warnings, felt that their use of magic might possibly draw the attention of the banished Burning Legion.\n\nTherefore, they decided to mask their lands within a protective barrier which would still allow them to work their enchantments. They constructed a series of monolithic Runestones at various points around Quel'Thalas which marked the boundaries of the magic barrier. The Runestones not only masked the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats, but helped to frighten away the superstitious troll warbands as well.\n\nAs time wore on, Quel'Thalas became a shining monument to the high elves' efforts and magical prowess. Its beauteous palaces were crafted in the same architectural style as the ancient halls of Kalimdor, yet they were interwoven with the natural topography of the land. Quel'Thalas had become the shining jewel that the elves had longed to create.\n\nThe Convocation of Silvermoon was founded as the ruling power over Quel'Thalas, though the Sunstrider Dynasty maintained a modicum of political power. Comprised of seven of the greatest high elf lords, the Convocation worked to secure the safety of the elven lands and people. Surrounded by their protective barrier, the high elves remained unmoved by the old warnings of the Kaldorei and continued to use magic flagrantly in almost all aspects of their lives.\n\nFor nearly four thousand years the high elves lived peacefully within the secluded safety of their kingdom. Nevertheless, the vindictive trolls were not so easily defeated. They plotted and schemed in the depths of the forests and waited for the numbers of their warbands to grow.

It was a crystal of great power, capable of sustaining an entire village on its energy alone. Some say that it was a gift passed on to our family by the naaru during the exodus from Argus - a connection that would explain its fabled power. Such speculation is for naught, however, since the crystal has been broken for as long as I can remember. The Shards of the Dream, as I call them, appear as powerless as any of the latent crystals found in the deep mines of Shadowmoon. I continue to seek a means of rejoining them in hopes that one day the Dream of Argus can be reborn, and that the draenei people could use it to flourish on our home of Draenor.\n\nOn a prospecting mission with some of the local Rangari, we happened upon a small enclave of Shadowmoon orcs, who were investigating the same mineral deposits. In idle discussion, the orcs spoke of rituals that they use to fuse smaller crystals together into large structures that can be stored with magical energy. I had never held previous interest in the Shadowmoon orcs' strange magics, but it seems it may hold the key to restoring the Dream of Argus.\n\nI must investigate this further.\n\nThe prelate council has denied my request for an envoy to be sent to the Shadowmoon orcs. They believe such an investigation to be folly, and that I am simply desperate to restore a broken relic. They cannot force me to stay, however. On the morrow I will strike out on my own, in hopes that the Shadowmoon will be willing to assist me in my efforts.\n\nI have travelled for days and have yet to come upon an orc of the Shadowmoon clan. Though there had been a noticeable lapse in trade with the orcs, we were unaware at how reclusive they had become recently. It is clear that I must make the perilous trek up the western cliffs. I can see the massive stone monoliths carved with the runes of their clan looming above the plateaus. I must seek the Shadowmoon there.\n\nIt appears that the Shadowmoon have withdrawn into their fortifications, though for what reason I am unsure. As I reached the top of the cliffs, I could see the members of their clan gathered in numbers I have never seen before in one place. The orcs acted strange, however they were not unfriendly. They called this place the Pillars of Fate, and it appeared as if they were readying some great magical rituals. When questioning about the purpose of the rituals, or the recent reclusiveness of their clan, the orcs only offered cryptic responses.\n\nThey did seem to be willing to discuss their methods of crystal reconstruction. An orc that was tending to some crystal structure of unknown purpose directed me to one called Lor Stonefist. She was a warrior of the Shadowmoon, as I understood it, and showed a particular affinity for the crystals native to the land.\n\nI was told she spent most of her time in the crystal cave to the north of the encampment. There she studied the native crystals for ways to improve their potential abilities. I will seek her there.\n\nStonefist was a tall and imposing woman. Her brutish features belied her intelligence, and I was quite surprised at how knowledgeable she was when we discussed the restoration of the crystal. She boasted that with the help of the Shadowmoon's magics, she could recombine any crystal to be as flawless as it would have been in nature. I would need to enlist the help of two other orcs in the camp in order to accomplish this: Vok Blacktongue and Koros Soulsplinter.\n\nBlacktongue, was a high ritualist of Shadowmoon, and a master runecarver. The ritual required a precise arrangement of runes, and due to the unique nature of my crystal we would require the work of an expert. She mentioned that the orc could normally found in one of the runemaster's huts in the southern part of the camp. They could be identified by the standing stones surrounding the structure, as well as the floating runestones above.\n\nThe other, Koros Soulsplinter, may be more difficult to locate. A reclusive hermit, Soulsplinter preferred to spend his time out of sight of the living. It is said, however, that he can often be seen among the graves upon the high hill, overlooking the camp below. There he would commune with the dead ancestors, whom it is said he preferred over his living brethren.\n\nI have managed to locate the two orcs, and they have agreed to assist myself and Stonefist. I will admit that their magic is strange to me, but I am mostly ignorant of these things. If their magic will help in restoring the Dream of Argus, then it is far from me to question it.\n\nWe located an empty cave on a terrace overlooking the Shadowmoon's great keep, Anguish Fortress, and under the instruction of Stonefist, I began constructing an altar. With the combined knowledge of draenei artificing and Shadowmoon mystic rune carving, we should be able to create a device capable of combining any crystal into its original form. The Dream of Argus will be reborn!\n\nConstruction continues on the altar device, however my allies appear to be growing restless. Some unknown force is stirring among the Shadowmoon, and they grow more hostile by the day. The orcs assisting me constantly argue in their language that I do not understand, and I fear they may not wish to help me much longer.\n\nI will continue to work, despite the growing tension.

Though he sought to appease his comrades, he soon reverted to true form and consumed the energies of a powerful warlock artifact known as the Skull of Gul'dan.\n\nBy doing so, Illidan developed demonic features and vastly magnified power. He also gained some of Gul'dan's old memories - especially those of the Tomb of Sargeras, the island dungeon rumored to hold the remains of the Dark Titan, Sargeras.\n\nBristling with power and free to roam the world once more, Illidan set out to find his own place in the great scheme of things. However, Kil'jaeden confronted Illidan and made him an offer he could not refuse. Kil'jaeden was angered by Archimonde's defeat at Mount Hyjal, but he had greater concerns than vengeance.\n\nSensing that his creation, the Lich King, was growing too powerful to control, Kil'jaeden ordered Illidan to destroy Ner'zhul and put an end to the undead Scourge once and for all. In exchange, Illidan would receive untold power and a true place amongst the remaining lords of the Burning Legion.\n\nIllidan agreed and immediately set out to destroy the Frozen Throne, the icy crystal cask in which the Lich King's spirit resided. Illidan knew that he would need a mighty artifact to destroy the Frozen Throne. Using the knowledge he had gained from Gul'dan's memories, Illidan decided to seek out the Tomb of Sargeras and claim the Dark Titan's remains.\n\nHe called in some old Highborne debts and lured the serpentine naga from their dark undersea lairs. Led by the cunning witch Lady Vashj the naga helped Illidan reach the Broken Isles, where Sargeras' Tomb was rumored to be located.\n\nAs Illidan set out with the naga, Warden Maiev Shadowsong began to hunt him. Maiev had been Illidan's jailor for ten thousand years and relished the prospect of recapturing him. However, Illidan outsmarted Maiev and her Watchers and succeeded in claiming the Eye of Sargeras despite their efforts. With the powerful Eye in his possession, Illidan traveled to the former wizard-city of Dalaran.\n\nStrengthened by the city's ley power lines, Illidan used the Eye to cast a destructive spell against the Lich King's citadel of Icecrown in distant Northrend. Illidan's attack shattered the Lich King's defenses and ruptured the very roof of the world.

King Llane, the noble monarch of Stormwind, grew wary of the darkness which seemed to taint the spirit of his former friend.\n\nKing Llane shared his concerns with Anduin Lothar, the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline, whom he named his lieutenant-at-arms. Even so, neither man could have imagined that Medivh's slow descent into madness would bring about the horrors that were to come.\n\nAs a final incentive, Sargeras promised to bestow great power upon Gul'dan if he agreed to lead the Horde to Azeroth. Through Medivh, Sargeras told the warlock that he could become a living god if he found the undersea tomb where the Guardian Aegwynn had placed Sargeras' crippled body nearly a thousand years before.\n\nGul'dan agreed and decided that once the denizens of Azeroth were beaten, he would find the legendary tomb and claim his reward. Assured that the Horde would serve his purposes, Sargeras ordered the invasion to begin.\n\nThrough a joint effort, Medivh and the warlocks of the Shadow Council opened the dimensional gateway known as the Dark Portal. This portal bridged the distance between Azeroth and Draenor, and it was large enough that armies might pass through it. Gul'dan dispatched orc scouts through the portal to survey the lands which they would conquer. The returning scouts assured the Shadow Council that the world of Azeroth was ripe for the taking.\n\nStill convinced that Gul'dan's corruption would destroy his people, Durotan spoke out against the warlocks once more. The brave warrior claimed that warlocks were destroying the purity of the orcish spirit and that this reckless invasion would be their doom. Gul'dan, unable to risk killing such a popular hero, was forced to exile Durotan and his Frostwolf Clan into the far reaches of this new world.\n\nAfter the exiled Frostwolves charged through the portal, only a few orc clans followed. These orcs quickly set up a base of operations within the Black Morass, a dark and swampy area far to the east of the kingdom of Stormwind. As the orcs began to branch out and explore the new lands, they came into immediate conflict with the human defenders of Stormwind.\n\nThough these skirmishes usually ended quickly, they did much to illustrate the weaknesses and strengths of both rival species. Llane and Lothar were never able to gather accurate data of the orcs' numbers and could only guess at how great a force they would have to contend with.\n\nAfter a few years the majority of the orcish Horde had crossed into Azeroth, and Gul'dan deemed that the time for the primary strike against humanity had come. The Horde launched its full might against the unsuspecting kingdom of Stormwind.\n\nAs the forces of Azeroth and the Horde clashed across the kingdom, internal conflicts began to take their toll on both armies. King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering Azeroth, contemptuously held his position at his capital of Stormwind. However, Sir Lothar became convinced that the battle should be taken directly to the enemy, and he was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king.\n\nChoosing to follow his instincts, Lothar stormed Medivh's tower-fortress of Karazhan with the help of the wizard's young apprentice, Khadgar. Khadgar and Lothar succeeded in vanquishing the possessed Guardian, whom they confirmed to be the source of the conflict.\n\nBy killing Medivh's body, Lothar and the young apprentice inadvertently banished the spirit of Sargeras to the abyss. As a consequence, the pure, virtuous spirit of Medivh was also allowed to live on... and wander the astral plane for many years to come.\n\nAlthough Medivh had been defeated, the Horde continued to dominate the defenders of Stormwind. As the Horde's victory drew nearer, Orgrim Doomhammer, one of the greatest orc chieftains, began to see the depraved corruption that had spread throughout the clans since their time in Draenor.\n\nHis old comrade, Durotan, returned from exile and warned him yet again of Gul'dan's treachery. In speedy retribution, Gul'dan's assassins murdered Durotan and his family, leaving only his infant son alive. Unknown to Doomhammer was the fact that Durotan's infant son was found by the human officer, Aedelas Blackmoore, and taken as a slave. That infant orc would one day rise to become the greatest leader his people would ever know.\n\nIncensed by Durotan's death, Orgrim set out to free the Horde from demonic corruption and ultimately assumed the role of warchief of the Horde by killing Gul'dan's corrupt puppet, Blackhand. Under his decisive leadership the relentless Horde finally laid siege to Stormwind Keep.\n\nKing Llane had severely underestimated the might of the Horde, and he watched helplessly as his kingdom fell to the green-skinned invaders. Ultimately King Llane was assassinated by one of the Shadow Council's finest killers: the half-orc, Garona.\n\nLothar and his warriors, returning home from Karazhan, hoped to stem the loss of life and save their once-glorious homeland. Instead, they returned too late and found their beloved kingdom in smoking ruins. The orcish Horde continued to ravage the countryside and claimed the surrounding lands for its own.

Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.\n\nAjeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.\n\nAnd then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.\n\nWe sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.

But Malfurion, honor bound to enter the changing Dreamways, bid the priestess farewell and swore that they would never be apart so long as they held true to their love.\n\nLeft alone to protect Kalimdor from the dangers of the new world, Tyrande assembled a powerful fighting force from amongst her night elf sisters. The fearless, highly trained warrior women who pledged themselves to Kalimdor's defense became known as the Sentinels.

The wind is dead, stagnant, almost frozen in place.\n\nWhat follows are, presumably, the last words of myself, explorer J. M. Harrington, as I have been chosen to accompany a small group of sailors on a rowboat to scout out the mists.\n\nI eagerly await the dragon-sized fish that will undoubtedly swallow our small vessel and save me from the horror of returning to a ship with only one place to relieve oneself.\n\nLand! Glorious landfall! We have found a small, peculiar island that does not appear to exist on any known map of the area. The sailors were jubilant, and several of the younger men immediately set out in search of the gold and riches that would surely be awaiting them in a skull-covered chest. They have not been seen in several hours.\n\nWe begin exploration immediately. If we cannot find food, we will all perish in a matter of days. Though I have my trusty hunting rifle, I fear for my safety. I do not think that humans have set foot on this island in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.\n\nI will do my duty as a proper explorer and document all that I see, in the hopes that someday these pages find their way into the hands of another ambitious adventurer with far more courage than sense.\n\nThe Windfeather Crane\n\nWe have stumbled across a glorious bird species capable of producing brilliant plumage, and highly protective of their nests.\n\nThe birds seem to have an affinity with the winds, and can smooth down their feathers, allowing them to strike rapidly at predators. The matriarchs of the species sing a soothing melody, calming the chicks when they are agitated. The males seem particularly fierce, and will ruffle their feathers to sweep a powerful gust of wind at attackers.\n\nWe have hunted the Windfeather for their meat in particular, which makes for a savory, if lean, meal. The feathers themselves seem to lighten the men's spirits, and I must wonder if they have magical properties. I have, on several occasions, seen rustling eggs amongst the nests. If I am able, I shall procure one to hatch on my own for further investigation.\n\nThe Ironfur Yak\n\nA great beast that seems to move and think at a glacial pace, the thick coats of the Ironfur Yaks dwarf any ram hide seen in Alterac.\n\nPowerful horns give the Ironfur a thrusting attack that can send a full-grown sailor off-balance, and more than once have I seen a man's leg trampled into the dirt as one of the larger bulls charged at us. We have taken to scattering immediately for the nearest tree just as soon as one of the great males begins to paw the ground.\n\nThe meat of the Ironfur contains more fat, and is more filling, than that of the Windfeather. With the fruit found abundantly in the trees nearby, we should be able to subsist for many days here, provided the denizens of the island do not kill us first.\n\nI was awoken this morning to a most curious racket. One of the men had somehow found his way atop one of the powerful bulls. I am certain the Ironfur thought that its response - to tear madly across the island - was quite appropriate.\n\nThe Great Turtle\n\nLarger and more sturdy than its cousins seen around the riverbeds of Southshore, the Great Turtle's shell is a whirl of intricate designs, should one ever get close enough to study.\n\nWhen frightened, the turtle may lash out with a bite powerful enough to cut a cutlass in half. Should the creature pull its head into its shell, do not think it is to retreat. The men were quite caught off-guard when the shell began to spin madly, severing Ol' Jim's hand clean off. We dare not go near the elders off of the coast, which look brutish enough to swallow a man whole.\n\nWhile the turtles have bequeathed us a spongy, if filling, meat, the men seem more keen on playing with the shells. When thrown, the shell will whirl through the air a distance longer than one would think, often catching one's napping companion off-guard. Several casualties have resulted.\n\nOn a separate note, sailor Wallace was sent back to the Barnacle this morning with a full supply of meats and fruits.\n\nThe Spineclaw Crab\n\nWe continue to search the island for clues and supplies, and happened upon an unusual species of crab today. Covered in hard, chitinous spines, I would venture to guess that some of these creatures are thousands of years old.\n\nAfter a diet consisting of meats and fruits, our crew was eager to once again feast on crab legs. Perhaps sensing our intentions, one of the great beasts unleashed a flurry of razor-sharp claw strikes against a young sailor, impaling him dozens of times before he knew what had happened. Though the beast made an attempt to retreat deep into the waters, the men made sure that a good meal would not escape so easily.\n\nHaving lost my favorite hat in the storm that took our vessel some days ago, I have taken to wearing one of the brightly-colored crab shells as a makeshift helm. The men have commented on this on more than one occasion, thinking that I may be losing my mind.\n\nPerhaps I am, or perhaps I am simply getting used to this place.\n\nThe Spotted Swarmer\n\nBy some great fortune, we seem to have found a village. As always, the explorer approaches with caution, lest he or she interfere with the local populace. Surrounding the village are several bright flowering bushes, abuzz with the soft chewing noises of small, spotted silkworms.\n\nUpon approach, the worms will swarm their would-be victim, coating them with a vile toxin. Though small, they are not to be underestimated. My stores of anti-venom are nearly depleted after today.\n\nUpon dissection, I have found that the creature's silk glands produce a silken cord far more powerful than even the strongest steel. With it, we have begun to fashion a raft of sorts, lashing the nearby tree stalks together with the sticky substance.\n\nIt has been nearly a week, and neither Wallace nor the rowboat has returned. The men fear for our ship, as do I.\n\nSpirits of Old Pi'jiu\n\nToday, we ventured even deeper into the old village of Pi'jiu. It did not surprise a seasoned adventurer such as myself that the spirits of the deceased villagers would haunt such a place. Somehow, it would have been even more strange to find the village deserted.\n\nThe spirits battle fiercely with martial techniques the likes of which we have never seen, spinning around in a lightning-fast array of kicks, conjuring mists to mend allies, and calling forth a powerful orb of unknown substance to strike at foes. Without the First Mate leading a properly-coordinated battle unit, we would have joined them in their eternal unrest.\n\nI have found a bottle of a strange, ethereal brew in one of the huts. Upon closer inspection, there seems to be a spirit trapped inside. I will leave it closed for now - I have a feeling that it will be of use to me.\n\nThe Stalking Tiger\n\nChasms hem us in on either side, setting the men on edge. We have seen paw prints on the ground around some of the crane nests and today we followed them to a winding path skirted with odd red stones. Lounging in the shade of the few trees that dot the path, we found brutal cats the size of horses.\n\nOne of the men brushed up against a red stone, and with a wild look in his eyes charged into battle against a pack of the fierce beasts. With masterful agility he ducked the swipes of monstrous claws the size of his own head, emerging victorious atop a steaming pile of blood-soaked fur.\n\nThe luxurious hide and plentiful meat of these primal beasts will sell for much coin back home. Perhaps on some hidden cove of this strange island, a ship awaits us. It is a thought I must entertain if I am to keep my sanity.\n\nThe Mighty Cliffdwellers\n\nThey can be heard from miles away, and have on more than one occasion woken me up from a sound sleep with the distant rumbling of falling stones. The enormous cliffdwellers, creatures emerged from the very stones we walk upon, pace the run endlessly.\n\nWhy they are here, I do not know. Perhaps over the course of many years, stone becomes bored, and uproots itself in search of adventure, or simply a change in scenery.\n\nI do know that even a single footfall can crush a man flat, and more than one man has perished in this fashion. The gem-encrusted hides of the strange creatures glitter in the sun with thousands of untold gems and riches. A fool's errand.\n\nThe Gulp Frog\n\nToday we discovered a small hollow on the eastern shore filled with strange and colorful amphibians. The bloated corpses of many great beasts indicated that, like everything on this island, these creatures were far more than they appeared.\n\nThe skin of the frogs is coated with a viscous, toxic substance. Preliminary pokes at one of the smaller specimens resulted in the rapid deterioration of my poking stick.\n\nI procured one of the lily pads that dot the area. Upon inspection, these particular plant species seem to have developed a thick waxy coating in order to protect themselves from the frog toxin. An interesting symbiotic relationship, I shall save one for further study at a later date.\n\nWe found little else, and still no means of leaving this island. Personally, I am getting quite used to the tropical atmosphere, and find myself plagued with strange thoughts of staying behind. Perhaps forever.\n\nThe Death Adder\n\nOne minute Short John was there, and the next he was not. The great serpent slithered back into the dark flora with its meal, and we gave chase.\n\nThe great fangs of the beast tore through iron shields and swallowed sharpened battle-axes whole, without a second thought or hint of indigestion.\n\nSurprisingly, when the beast had been thoroughly carved by blade and mace, Short John emerged from the distended stomach, nearly unharmed and chewing on a roasted yak leg he had found inside of the snake.\n\nNow, the question is, who roasted the yak? Surely not the snake... ?\n\nThe Jademist Dancer\n\nWe have completed our tour of the western shores of the island, finding a misty strand at the pinnacle of our exploration to the northern banks.\n\nSmall shapes flitted in and out of the mist, which scalded our exposed skin even at a distance, and we dared not approach further.\n\nSquinting into the ever-surging mists, I believe I caught a glimpse at a small cairn of stones. Something about the stones intrigues me greatly. I shall have to return to investigate further.\n\nA Strange Cavern - The Foreboding Flame\n\nWe have stumbled upon a strange cavern lit by an eerie blue light, not unlike the Singing Bogs in the children's tales. Just like in the stories, the lights called to my companions and myself, and we delved deep into the cavern.\n\nWe were surrounded when the lights took on a menacing illumination, and our skin began to burn with unearthly fire. We screamed, and we ran until we could run no more.\n\nBonfires, lit by the same blue light, dotted the damp caves, but gave off no warmth. Simply being near them eased our pain, and we fought back the blazing lights.\n\nWe told these tales to frighten children away from the dangerous wetlands. Perhaps we should have listened ourselves.\n\nThere are only six of us, now.\n\nA Strange Cavern - The Damp Shambler\n\nThere was only one way to go - forward. We made our way into the deepest grottos of the dank cavern, followed by the whispers of the spirits of our dead. They would find no rest in this place.\n\nWe were greatly surprised when the moss and lichen lining the wall detached itself and began shambling towards us. A choking gas billowed from its many fungal blossoms. The vines and ferns making up its hide regrew rapidly wherever it was struck.\n\nBacked into a corner, we did the only thing we could. When the moss chose its victim, we escaped.\n\nThe echoes of his cries will haunt me until the end of my days.\n\nThe Ordon - Candlekeeper\n\nWhen we returned to our camp near the old village, we found it ransacked, and many of our supplies burned on a great pyre. This was no mere animal - something wanted us off of this island.\n\nIn the night, they came. Heralded by the blast of a deep battle-horn, great bull-men wielding blazing arms dragged three of our men screaming into the darkness.\n\nWith a great breath, one bull-man breathed out a gout of flame that set half of the camp on fire, scattering us into the jungle and covering their escape.\n\nTo my great surprise, the spirits of the village awaited us when we returned to the camp. They did not speak, but pointed towards a distant stone arch and nodded. Perhaps it is their intent to aid us?\n\nThe Ordon - Fire-Watcher\n\nA great battle, perhaps the greatest I have ever experienced, took place around me as I hid inside one of the crates of the great bull-men. My rifle did little to slow their charge, though the spirits around us fought fiercely, a silent tide of death in the darkness.\n\nThe Ordon were not without magical prowess, conjuring great balls of fire that rained down upon those nearby, blackening the ground around them. One such wizard caught one of our men full in the chest with a massive boulder of fire, blasting his torso clear apart from the remainder of his limbs.\n\nIn the commotion, I have procured some of the carved symbols and robes of the wizened of the bull-men. With some work, I may be able to fashion a costume of sorts, and perhaps ward others away from my location.\n\nThe Ordon - Oathguard\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief as the great warriors of the bull-men let me pass in my makeshift garb. I proceeded further up the mountain, catching a glimpse of a ruined temple in the distance. Perhaps here I will find my eternal salvation.\n\nThe great brutish warriors were quite intelligent in combat, when I reflect back upon the battle. When attacked, they would raise heavy shields, deflecting nearly all blows and allowing their brethren to flank foes. When attention was turned to their allies, they would chant a deep, guttural melody, surrounding their allies with a mystical sheathe.\n\nTheir cooperation is a bitter reminder of my solitude. I am alone now, save for my thoughts and this journal.\n\nThe Ordon - Burning Berserker\n\nI can do little but hide in this ruined tower and watch the world pass around me.\n\nI see more of the bull-men, wielding blazing daggers, gathering herbs and foliage from the rolling hills. I can only surmise that the rapidly-growing underbrush serves to keep their eternal braziers alight.\n\nWhen pounced upon by one of the great cats, a vicious battle erupted. I questioned which of the two - blazing bull-man or primal tiger - was more animal. The bull-man whirled around, carving deep gashes into the beast, before alighting both daggers on fire and plunging them deep into the creature's neck.\n\nI am so very hungry. I will not last long if I do not keep moving - but to where?\n\nThe Ashleaf Sprites\n\nMy salvation came in the dead of night, as a screaming fireball flew overhead.\n\nThe woodland creatures that make the trees their home appear to be foes of the great flying serpents and bull-men of the area. As the blast of hot magma arced towards one of the trees, the little wood men formed a shield of leaves, deflecting the fire and warding off the would-be attacker.\n\nThe impact of the blazing ball shook several large nuts to the ground. While the little wood men warded their tree against another assault, I snuck in and procured a few of the gourds, as well as some of the leafy berries off of one of the wood men that did not survive.\n\nThe nuts were filling and berries heavy with a rejuvenating syrup. I feel nearly strong enough to leave this place now.\n\nThe Crimsonscale Firestorm\n\nThe strange, and beautiful, serpents seemed to be playing a game with the little wood men. They would circle for hours, then assault one of the wood men's trees with a burst of fire. The wood men seemed adept at shielding their homes, and the great serpents did not seem to be interested in destroying the men themselves.\n\nIt reminded me of my cat, Simon, whom I had left in the care of a friend. Thinking of Simon reminded me that I did not know how long I had been stranded here. Was it days, weeks, years? And what had happened to the Barnacle?I was broken out of my reverie by a violent battle between two of the great serpents. Breath of fire cut swathes of light through the dark night sky, temporarily blinding me. Pools of blazing magma erupted across the ground. It must have been a territorial dispute, because the victorious serpent seemed uninterested in the charred corpse of his adversary.\n\nClutched in the burned hands I found a most curious egg.\n\nThe Ordon - Molten Guardian\n\nGreat golems made of stone and fire bar my way further up the mountain. Do I dare try to pass them as I passed the bull-men before? My costume has gotten better, with twigs and brush propping up the shoulders, giving me the silhouette of a true bull-man. I daresay I could walk right in. What is the harm in trying?I clutched the egg to my chest protectively as I passed by the guardian. The blazing heat radiated off of it in waves, searing my flesh. Where was I going? I did not know. Up, I suppose.\n\nI found a smoldering kiln that may be used to create the golems. A burned-out husk lay nearby, along with a stone that appeared to blaze without ceasing. Perhaps the stone was used to imbue the creature with life? But where did such stones come from?At that moment I was grabbed from behind, and the world went black.\n\nThe Ordon - Blazebound Chanter\n\nThese bull-men, more well-dressed than their brethren and with weaponry carved with intricate runes, carried me to the great pyre at the center of their temple.\n\nI can only assume one of their religious order presided over the initial searing of my flesh. They spoke in an unknown language as they carved into my skin with white-hot daggers. A rain of burning meteors fell around us, obscuring the temple from outsiders while the bull-men performed their tortuous rituals.\n\nWhen they had finished, the chanter spoke a word of power and called forth a monster of magma and stone.\n\nI could only surmise that my soul would be formed into one of the burning stones, and used to power a lifeless automaton for all time.\n\nThe Ordon - Eternal Kilnmaster\n\nThe muscular guard thrust his polearm into the ground, conjuring forth an eruption of flames that spread into my obsidian cell. I ceased my wails for a short time.\n\nI did not know what they planned to do to me, but I did know that my journey had come to an end. Despite myself, my curiosity firmly took hold, and I continued to watch them in earnest.\n\nI noticed that then these hulking bull-men came close to their campfire, a cauldron of flames, they seemed empowered by the fire. But I could not think of a way to use this to my advantage, and crumpled into a heap in the corner of my cell to await my fate.\n\nThe Ordon - High Priest\n\nI was brought to the center of the bull-men's great temple once again. Before me stood an imposing figure, a bull-man that radiated such power that I nearly had to close my eyes, lest I be blinded. His hands were charred black, and fur similarly burned in places.\n\nI was led to a great cauldron. In their guttural speech, the word \"Ordos\" rang out several times with obvious reverence. In the distance, a great figure approached, his mane an ever-burning inferno, his eyes weeping tears of molten magma. A spear in the back pushed me ever closer to the cauldron in front of me.\n\nIn desperation, I flung the serpent egg into the cauldron. It was my last, and only, resort. The egg burst open, and a small serpent emerged, shook itself, and rapidly began to ascend.\n\nI leapt, grabbing the tail of the creature as it flew high into the sky. But I could not hold on for long, and soon I found myself plunging into the cold, dark waters far below.\n\nInside the Great Evermaw\n\nAs the icy waves closed around me, I found myself swept up in a powerful current and deposited into a rank hollow.\n\nMy surroundings became lit for but a moment as the cavern behind me opened to allow a fresh rush of sea water, and it was then that I realized that I had been swallowed by a great fish.\n\nBefore the maw closed again, I took note of my surroundings. The smooth, muscled walls stretched far back into the distance. Deposits of flotsam and jetsam had become lodged in various locations - from the wreckage of ships small and large to the picked-over bones of strange undersea creatures.\n\nFar back in the cavern, I saw a faint light. For some reason, it reminded me of the soothing whispers I had heard on the misty northwestern shore. And thus I found the lantern - a dull, rusted thing, but somehow comforting.\n\nAnd so here I sit, writing an end to my tale that none will hear.\n\nFinal Entry\n\nIt has found me! No, no no, I have found it! Yes! It was meant to be, this is where I was always meant to be, a portal to the future, to my future.\n\nThe lantern illuminates my scrawling, it helps me find the way. Vazuvius calls.\n\nAnd so I will answer. I will light the lantern and plunge my head into the stagnant waters, and breathe deep the salty air of my brethren.\n\nAND I WILL JOIN THE DREAD CREW IN ETERNAL PLUNDER.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14370", "title": "Blood-Spattered Zandalari Journal", "text": "I tell them others the loa don't speak to me, but I see them all over, I hear them talk about me, I hear them tell me to give up.

A great citadel was erected above the Icecrown Glacier and manned by the growing legions of the dead. Yet as the Lich King extended his influence over the land, one shadowy empire stood against his power.\n\nThe ancient subterranean kingdom of Azjol-Nerub, which had been founded by a race of sinister humanoid spiders, sent their elite warrior-guard to attack Icecrown and end the Lich King's mad bid for dominance. Much to his frustration, Ner'zhul found that the evil nerubians were immune not only to the plague, but to his telepathic domination as well.\n\nThe nerubian spider-lords commanded vast forces and had an underground network that stretched nearly half the breadth of Northrend. Their hit-and-run tactics on the Lich King's strongholds stymied his efforts to root them out time after time. Ultimately Ner'zhul's war against the nerubians was won by attrition. With the aid of the sinister dreadlords and innumerable undead warriors, the Lich King invaded Azjol-Nerub and brought its subterranean temples crashing down upon the spider lords' heads.\n\nThough the nerubians were immune to his plague, Ner'zhul's growing necromantic powers allowed him to raise the spider-warriors' corpses and bend them to his will. As a testament to their tenacity and fearlessness, Ner'zhul adopted the nerubians' distinctive architectural style for his own fortresses and structures.\n\nLeft to rule his kingdom unopposed, the Lich King began preparing for his true mission in the world.

Most notable of them was the archmage of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad, who was one of senior members of the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's ruling council. He had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy.\n\nDriven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he resigned himself to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King.\n\nLeaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend.\n\nIntent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of Azjol-Nerub. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of Ner'zhul's power. He began to realize that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King might be both wise and potentially fruitful.\n\nAfter long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of Icecrown. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the undead guardsmen silently let him pass as though he was expected.\n\nKel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. There, in the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the Frozen Throne and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead.\n\nThe Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Eager for dark knowledge and power, Kel'Thuzad accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god.\n\nTo help the archmage accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into a state of trust and belief. Then, once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be - and a new figurehead to call their king.\n\nKel'Thuzad returned to Lordaeron in disguise, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the Cult of the Damned, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on Azeroth in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul.\n\nAs the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. It was surprisingly easy for Kel'Thuzad to achieve his goal: namely, to transfer the citizens' faith in the Holy Light into belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to hide its workings from the authorities of Lordaeron.\n\nWith Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague-energies into a number of portable artifacts called plague-cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron, where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages.\n\nThe cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague-generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.\n\nThe Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves.\n\nThe cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge, for soon it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14379", "title": "Defias Script", "text": "The plan is set in motion.\n\nTake that once-great bastion of faith, Heroes' Vigil, as our base camp, and we'll begin to move reinforcements to you from Westfall once you have sent word that it has been suitably prepared.\n\nThe area is all but forgotten to the citizens and soldiers of Stormwind, and should prove a perfect staging point for our attacks.

Most of our time was preoccupied with making the necessary arrangements to establish a base camp. I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet. Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago. As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.\n\nFor this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot. I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance. Seeing her grown is quite special. Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry. Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.\n\nSir S. J. Erlgadin comes from human aristocracy. His father, Count Erlgadin, was renowned for his generosity. It was the Count who lobbied for improved working conditions for the Stonemasons' Guild during the restoration of Stormwind after the Second Great War.\n\nIn the years that followed, after Stormwind betrayed the Stonemasons' Guild, Sir Erlgadin grew bitter about the role of the nobles within the Kingdom. He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles. But I digress. The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography. This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn.\n\nWe rose with the sun. Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted. The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger. A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap. Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.\n\nJust as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil. But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at. For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.\n\nWe set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle. Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey. The morning passed in frustrated silence. Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze. By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey. Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.\n\nDuring one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder. Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness. Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree. Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.", "authors": ["Hemet Nesingwary "]}, {"id": "14383", "title": "The New Horde", "text": "The chief warden of the internment camps, Aedelas Blackmoore, watched over the captive orcs from his prison-stronghold, Durnholde. One orc in particular had always held his interest: the orphaned infant he had found nearly eighteen years before. Blackmoore had raised the young male as a favored slave and named him Thrall. Blackmoore taught the orc about tactics, philosophy, and combat. Thrall was even trained as a gladiator. All the while, the corrupt warden sought to mold the orc into a weapon.\n\nDespite his harsh upbringing, young Thrall grew into a strong, quick-witted orc, and he knew in his heart that a slave's life was not for him. As he grew to maturity, he learned about his people, the orcs, whom he had never met: after their defeat, most of them had been placed in internment camps. Rumor had it that Doomhammer, the orc leader, had escaped from Lordaeron and gone into hiding. Only one rogue clan still operated in secret, trying to evade the watchful eyes of the Alliance.\n\nThe resourceful yet inexperienced Thrall decided to escape from Blackmoore's fortress and set off to find others of his kind. During his journeys Thrall visited the internment camps and found his once-mighty race to be strangely cowed and lethargic. Having not found the proud warriors he hoped to discover, Thrall set out to find the last undefeated orc chieftain, Grom Hellscream.\n\nConstantly hunted by the humans, Hellscream nevertheless held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. Aided only by his own devoted Warsong clan, Hellscream continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of his beleaguered people. Unfortunately, Hellscream could never find a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. The impressionable Thrall, inspired by Hellscream's idealism, developed a strong empathy for the Horde and its warrior traditions.\n\nSeeking the truth of his own origins, Thrall traveled north to find the legendary Frostwolf clan. Thrall learned that Gul'dan had exiled the Frostwolves during the early days of the First War. He also discovered that he was the son and heir of the orc hero Durotan, the true chieftain of the Frostwolves who had been murdered in the wilds nearly twenty years before.\n\nUnder the tutelage of the venerable shaman Drek'Thar, Thrall studied his people's ancient shamanistic culture, which had been forgotten under Gul'dan's evil rule. Over time, Thrall became a powerful shaman and took his rightful place as chieftain of the exiled Frostwolves. Empowered by the elements themselves and driven to find his destiny, Thrall set off to free the captive clans and heal his race of demonic corruption.\n\nDuring his travels, Thrall found the aged warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, who had been living as a hermit for many years. Doomhammer, who had been a close friend of Thrall's father, decided to follow the young, visionary orc and help him free the captive clans. Supported by many of the veteran chieftains, Thrall ultimately succeeded in revitalizing the Horde and giving his people a new spiritual identity.\n\nTo symbolize his people's rebirth, Thrall returned to Blackmoore's fortress of Durnholde and put a decisive end to his former master's plans by laying siege to the internment camps. This victory was not without its price: during the liberation of one camp, Doomhammer fell in battle.\n\nThrall took up Doomhammer's legendary warhammer and donned his black plate-armor to become the new warchief of the Horde. During the following months, Thrall's small but volatile Horde laid waste to the internment camps and stymied the Alliance's best efforts to counter his clever strategies.

Arthas succeeded in killing Kel'Thuzad, but even so, the undead ranks swelled with every soldier that fell defending the land. Frustrated and stymied by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly extreme steps to conquer them. Finally Arthas' comrades warned him that he was losing his hold on his humanity.\n\nArthas' fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. He tracked the plague's source to Northrend, intending to end its threat forever. Instead, Prince Arthas eventually fell prey to the Lich King's tremendous power. Believing that it would save his people, Arthas took up the cursed runeblade, Frostmourne.\n\nThough the sword did grant him unfathomable power, it also stole his soul and transformed him into the greatest of the Lich King's death knights.

There the lich would obtain the powerful spellbook of Medivh, and use it to summon Archimonde back into the world. From that point on, Archimonde himself would begin the Legion's final invasion. Not even the wizards of the Kirin Tor could stop Arthas' forces from stealing Medivh's book, and soon Kel'Thuzad had all he needed to perform his spell.\n\nAfter ten thousand years, the mighty demon Archimonde and his host emerged once again upon the world of Azeroth. Yet Dalaran was not their final destination. Under orders from Kil'jaeden himself, Archimonde and his demons followed the undead Scourge to Kalimdor, bent on destroying Nordrassil, the World Tree.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, a lone, mysterious prophet appeared to lend the mortal races guidance. This prophet proved to be none other than Medivh, the last Guardian, miraculously returned from the Beyond to redeem himself for past sins. Medivh told the Horde and the Alliance of the dangers they faced and urged them to band together.\n\nJaded by generations of hate, the orcs and humans would have none of it. Medivh was forced to deal with each race separately, using prophecy and trickery to guide them across the sea to the legendary land of Kalimdor. The orcs and humans soon encountered the long-hidden civilization of the Kaldorei.\n\nThe orcs, led by Thrall, suffered a series of setbacks on their journey across Kalimdor's Barrens. Though they befriended Cairne Bloodhoof and his mighty tauren warriors, many orcs began to succumb to the demonic bloodlust that had plagued them for years. Thrall's greatest lieutenant, Grom Hellscream, even betrayed the Horde by giving himself over to his baser instincts.\n\nAs Hellscream and his loyal Warsong warriors stalked through the forests of Ashenvale, they clashed with the ancient night elf Sentinels. Certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways, the demigod Cenarius came forth to drive Hellscream and his orcs back. Yet Hellscream and his orcs, overcome with supernatural hate and rage, managed to kill Cenarius and corrupt the ancient forestlands.\n\nUltimately, Hellscream redeemed his honor by helping Thrall defeat Mannoroth, the demon lord who first cursed the orcs with his bloodline of hate and rage. With Mannoroth's death, the orcs' blood-curse was finally brought to an end.\n\nWhile Medivh worked to convince the orcs and humans of the need for an alliance, the night elves fought the Legion in their own secretive ways. Tyrande Whisperwind, the immortal High Priestess of the night elf Sentinels, battled desperately to keep the demons and undead from overrunning the forests of Ashenvale. Tyrande realized that she needed help, so she set out to awaken the night elf druids from their thousand-year slumber.\n\nCalling upon her ancient love, Malfurion Stormrage, Tyrande succeeded in galvanizing her defenses and driving the Legion back. With Malfurion's help, nature herself rose up to vanquish the Legion and its Scourge allies.\n\nWhile searching for more of the hibernating druids, Malfurion found the ancient barrow prison in which he had chained his brother, Illidan. Convinced that Illidan would aid them against the Legion, Tyrande set him free. Though Illidan did aid them for a time, he eventually fled to pursue his own interests.\n\nThe night elves braced themselves and fought the Burning Legion with grim determination.

However, their society grew too large within the confines of their mountain cities. Though the mighty High King, Modimus Anvilmar, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society.\n\nThe Bronzebeard clan, ruled by Thane Madoran Bronzebeard, held close ties to the High King and stood as the traditional defenders of Ironforge Mountain. The Wildhammer clan, ruled by Thane Khardros Wildhammer, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city.\n\nThe third faction, the Dark Iron clan, was ruled by the sorcerer-thane Thaurissan. The Dark Irons hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins.\n\nFor a time the three factions kept a tenuous peace, but tensions erupted when High King Anvilmar passed away from old age. The three ruling clans went to war for control of Ironforge itself. The dwarf civil war raged under the earth for many years. Eventually the Bronzebeards, who had the largest standing army, banished the Dark Irons and Wildhammers from under the mountain.\n\nKhardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north through the barrier gates of Dun Algaz, and they founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of Grim Batol. There, the Wildhammers thrived and rebuilt their stores of treasure. Thaurissan and his Dark Irons did not fare as well. Humiliated and enraged by their defeat, they vowed revenge against Ironforge. Leading his people far to the south, Thaurissan founded a city (which he named after himself) within the beautiful Redridge Mountains.\n\nProsperity and the passing of years did little to ease the Dark Iron's rancor toward their cousins. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. The Dark Irons were intent on claiming all of Khaz Modan for their own.\n\nThe Dark Iron armies smashed against their cousins' strongholds and very nearly took both kingdoms. However, Madoran Bronzebeard ultimately led his clan to a decisive victory over Thaurissan's sorcerous army. Thaurissan and his servants fled back to the safety of their city, unaware of the events transpiring at Grim Batol, where Modgud's army would fare no better against Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors.\n\nAs she confronted the enemy warriors, Modgud used her powers to strike fear into their hearts. Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen.\n\nWith their queen lost, the Dark Irons fled before the fury of the Wildhammers. They raced south toward their king's stronghold, only to meet the armies of Ironforge, which had come to aid Grim Batol. Crushed between two armies, the remaining Dark Iron forces were utterly destroyed.\n\nThe combined armies of Ironforge and Grim Batol then turned south, intent on destroying Thaurissan and his Dark Irons once and for all. They had not gone far when Thaurissan's fury resulted in a spell of cataclysmic proportions. Seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would ensure his victory, Thaurissan called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To his shock, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.\n\nRagnaros the Firelord, immortal lord of all fire elementals, had been banished by the Titans when the world was young. Now, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation.\n\nThe volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by the Searing Gorge to the north and the Burning Steppes to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. They remain within the depths of Blackrock to this day.\n\nWitnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, King Madoran and King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros.\n\nThe Bronzebeards returned to Ironforge and rebuilt their glorious city. The Wildhammers also returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable.\n\nThey were bitter in their hearts over the loss of their beloved home. King Bronzebeard offered the Wildhammers a place to live within the borders of Ironforge, but the Wildhammers steadfastly refused. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron. Settling within the lush forests of the Hinterlands, the Wildhammers crafted the city of Aerie Peak, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area.\n\nSeeking to retain relations and trade with their cousins, the dwarves of Ironforge constructed two massive arches, the Thandol Span, to bridge the gap between Khaz Modan and Lordaeron. Bolstered by mutual trade, the two kingdoms prospered. After the deaths of Madoran and Khardros, their sons jointly commissioned two great statues in honor of their fathers.\n\nThe two statues would stand guard over the pass into the southlands, which had become volcanic in the wake of Ragnaros' scorching presence. They served as both a warning to all who would attack the dwarven kingdoms, and as a reminder of what price the Dark Irons paid for their crimes.\n\nThe two kingdoms retained close ties for some years, but the Wildhammers were much changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They took to living above ground on the slopes of Aerie Peak, instead of carving a vast kingdom within the mountain. The ideological differences between the two remaining dwarven clans eventually led to their parting of ways.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14402", "title": "Demonic Pamphlet", "text": "FIRE OMENS\n\nThe flames foretell our destiny.

The learned soldier is the soldier that leans on the shoulder of experience. Let this book serve as a guide in your battle for Alterac Valley.\n\nChapter 1 - The Front Line\n\nDismantling the Stormpike army is very much like peeling an onion. To get to the core, you must start by removing the outermost layers.\n\nThe front lines, comprised mostly of Stormpike Mountaineers and Alliance Sentinels, are tied to the Captain's bunker. It is Captain Balinda Stonehearth who empowers these units and provides for reinforcements when the lines are under siege. Strike at the Captain and the front line forces will crumble.\n\nChapter 2 - The Twin Towers\n\nMake no mistake; Vanndar Stormpike is a cunning foe and certainly no fool. Once the front line has been breached, the secondary defensive targets must still be destroyed. It is the twin towers of Stonehearth and Icewing which control the Stormpike Guardsmen outside of Dun Baldar and the Stormpike patrols.\n\nBeware, soldier, as both of these towers are heavily fortified and ruled over by one of Vanndar's elite Commanders. Should your forces breach the fortifications, make certain that the Commander within has been ... silenced. This too will be part of the dismantling of the Stormpike.\n\nChapter 3 - The Four Commanders\n\nThe third layer of the Stormpike onion is comprised of the four Commanders. In this respect, Vanndar has mimicked our own glorious Frostwolf defenses. Of course he will tell you otherwise... But I digress. The four Commanders control the ebb and flow of the Stormpike Guardsmen that fiercely guard Dun Baldar. Silence them all and the Stormpike Guardsmen will fall. Then there is but one layer left to peel.\n\nChapter 4 - The Dun Baldar Bunkers\n\nAs you have undoubtedly noticed, the Stormpike defensive layers are in place to prevent one mighty power move from dismantling the entire army. Before you ask, yes, this is exactly how our own forces are setup and no, I will not change our defensive structure. They copied us, why should we have to change?\n\nWhere was I? Yes, so, the Dun Baldar bunkers (which are located in Dun Baldar) control the Stormpike Defenders - Vanndar's most trusted and elite guard units. Destroy those two towers and the reinforcements sent to aid Vanndar will cease to exist.\n\nEpilogue\n\nAfter having done all of this, you are left with the center of the onion: The sweet core.

He dismounted and handed his reins to the ever-present stablemaster, placing one hand on her shoulder before speaking. \"Kama, have you considered our last conversation?\" Marcus asked, furrowing his eyebrows in mock seriousness. \n\nKama rolled her eyes, her Pandaren markings exaggerating the movement. \"I doubt my life-mate would think much of it.\"\n\nMarcus let out a bellowing laugh, looking over his shoulder as he walked away, \"I'd still like to meet her one day!\"\n\nThe Tavern in the Mists was unusually crowded, and he pushed his way through the crowd until he stood in the shadows of a dark corner. An exotic voice purred his name, \"Marcus, it is good to see you again.\"\n\nMarcus smiled and squinted as his eyes adjusted to the absence of light. \"Madam Goya, the pleasure is all mine.\" \n\nShe dipped in a polite bow; Marcus felt a sudden warmth as he was reminded why the term bouncy was often used to describe the Pandaren. He bowed in kind, catching Madam Goya's hand and kissing it gently, never shifting his gaze from the hulking bodyguard standing behind her, a single scar between his watchful eyes.\n\n\"So, Marcus, can I interest you in something... special? I'm afraid the usual cannot be offered today.\" Marcus did not miss her emphasis on 'the usual', nor the deep regret that laced her words. Their eyes met once again and she squeezed his hand before letting go. \n\n\"If that is your will, may I see what you have to offer?\" Marcus asked. \n\n\"There are several magnificent pieces of armor, a tiny companion, and even an exotic mount,\" Madam Goya answered, her typical playfulness quickly returning. She paused and held a hand to her chin, feigning thoughtfulness. \"But my most valuable treasures are located upstairs.\" \n\nMarcus's eyebrows lifted comically and his eyes widened before his expression settled into gleeful acceptance. \"Until we meet again, then.\" Her eyes fluttered and Marcus found himself walking up the stairs of the strange tavern.\n\nWaiting in the room at the top were two beings of such beauty that he nearly stumbled on the final step. One had long flowing hair the color of the Sunwell itself, and the other kept her ebon hair cropped short.

He unsheathed his mighty sword, bathing the blood elves in its pulsating glow.\n\nThe elf with radiant hair spoke first, \"Goodness, it looks like someone is ready for battle.\" She placed her hand on the tip of his sword, lowering it with gentle pressure as she crossed in front of him, always keeping her head cocked in his direction. \"Do you believe in love at first sight? Or should I walk by again...?\" \n\nMarcus leaned in close, carelessly pressing the hardened steel against her. He whispered something quietly in her ear and pulled away, eagerly searching her face for a reaction.\n\n\"No. No. I won't do that... but my sister will!\" the blonde giggled. The dark-haired one silently raised a single eyebrow, nodding and shrugging her delicate shoulders at the same time. With a subtle gesture, her body glowed with an intense inner fire, burning away what little clothing she wore. As Marcus's muscular arms wrapped around her, she whispered something to him. A symbol, unseen by Marcus, momentarily appeared above his head and surrounded him in a white glow. \n\n\"That... that feels amazing. What did you do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Fortitude, my lord.

It was during this war, in the heart of the Silithus desert, that a great tragedy and even greater burden beset Fandral Staghelm. It is thought that the events described herein are what ultimately shaped the unsavory disposition of the Arch Druid.\n\nAn ancient sentient insectoid race known as the Qiraji vied for dominance over much of Kalimdor at one point in time. It was the pompous, imperialistic Staghelm and his army of night elves who met the Qiraji head on in battle.\n\nFather and son fought fervently to contain the rising tide of the insectoid swarm in Silithus. From the fortress of Ahn'Qiraj, a seemingly endless stream of silithid continued to bolster the ranks of the invading Qiraji forces. The whole of Silithus was under siege.\n\nIn a decision that Staghelm would regret, the younger Staghelm, Valstann, was ordered to defend the night elf outpost of Southwind Village. Regrettably, Valstann would lose his life that day as Southwind Village would fall to the armies of Ahn'Qiraj.\n\nUndaunted and with heavy heart, a vengeful Fandral Staghelm would push on. Defeat in Silithus would result in great loss for the night elf nation and quite possibly the world.\n\nThe battle raged on for months. All of Silithus was overtaken by the Qiraji. Staghelm and his army were pushed back to Tanaris. With a decimated army and countless innocents slain, the arrogance that had driven Fandral Staghelm was snuffed out completely.\n\nHis pride wholly crushed. Staghelm would, for the second time in his existence, feel the flutter in the pit of his stomach that could only be brought on by fear. It was in Tanaris, then, that Staghelm would approach Anachronos, progeny of Nozdormu, and plead for the assistance of the Bronze Flight.\n\nInitially, Anachronos refused to involve the Bronze Flight in the affairs of the lesser races. It was not until the Qiraji brashly attacked the Caverns of Time that Anachronos would agree to join forces with the night elves.\n\nAnachronos would soon realize that even the mighty Bronze Flight could not stem the tide of the invading Qiraji forces. For every fifty of the insects that were annihilated by his breath, one hundred would be waiting to take their place. With the night elf lines faltering and the threat of being pushed further north to the wilds of Feralas ever looming, Anachronos decided that the children of the Aspects must be made aware.\n\nHe would call out to Ysera's Dragonflight first. Merithra of the Dream would answer his call and from there, Alexstrasza's Dragonflight and Malygos's Dragonflight would be made aware.\n\nThe dragons would meet in the stratosphere high above Silithus: Thousands of feet above the fortress of Ahn'Qiraj.\n\nThere was Anachronos, child of the Nozdormu, Aspect of Time. From the Emerald Dream would come Merithra, child of Ysera, Aspect of Nature.\n\nCaelestrasz, child of Alexstrasza, Aspect of Life, would represent the Red Dragonflight.\n\nArygos, child of Malygos, Aspect of Magic, would represent the Blue Dragonflight.\n\nThe dragons watched as an endless stream of silithid and Qiraji poured out of Ahn'Qiraj. It became clear to them that no amount of force could ever end this war. From inside the main temple, tens of thousands of the Qiraji forces waited. With each passing second, more were hatched and primed; ready to be unleashed into the world.\n\nArygos was the first to notice the strange emanations. The monolithic temple in the southern quadrant of Ahn'Qiraj radiated a dim magic unlike anything they had sensed coming from the Qiraji. Try as they might, none were able to penetrate further into the temple to find the source of this energy. Only something of immense power could shield itself so completely. Perhaps... something controlling the insects. Something controlling even the Qiraji.\n\nThe dragons knew that they had to react quickly, lest the world suffer another epic catastrophe. After careful deliberation, it was decided that the best course of action would be to stop the host armies at or near their source.\n\nA great barrier would be created, drawing from the essence of both the night elves and the dragonflight.

There were many Guardians over the years, but only one ever held the magical powers of Tirisfal at any given time. One of the last Guardians of the age distinguished herself as a mighty warrior against the shadow.\n\nAegwynn, a fiery human girl, won the approbation of the Order and was given the mantle of Guardianship. Aegwynn vigorously worked to hunt down and eradicate demons wherever she found them, but she often questioned the authority of the male-dominated Council of Tirisfal.\n\nShe believed that the ancient elves and the elderly men who presided over the council were too rigid in their thinking and not farsighted enough to put a decisive end to the conflict against chaos. Impatient with lengthy discussion and debate, she yearned to prove herself worthy to her peers and superiors, and as a result frequently chose valor over wisdom in crucial situations.\n\nAs her mastery over the cosmic power of Tirisfal grew, Aegwynn became aware of a number of powerful demons that stalked the icy northern continent of Northrend. Traveling to the distant north, Aegwynn tracked the demons into the mountains. There, she found that the demons were hunting one of the last surviving dragonflights and draining the ancient creatures of their innate magic.\n\nThe mighty dragons, who had fled from the ever-advancing march of mortal societies, found themselves too evenly matched against the dark magics of the Legion. Aegwynn confronted the demons, and with help from the noble dragons, eradicated them. Yet, as the last demon was banished from the mortal world, a great storm erupted throughout the north.\n\nAn enormous dark visage appeared in the sky above Northrend. Sargeras, the demon king and lord of the Burning Legion, appeared before Aegwynn and bristled with hellish energy. He informed the young Guardian that the time of Tirisfal was about to come to an end and that the world would soon bow before the onslaught of the Legion.\n\nThe proud Aegwynn, believing herself to be a match for the menacing god, unleashed her powers against Sargeras' avatar. With disconcerting ease, Aegwynn battered the demonlord with her powers and succeeded in killing his physical shell. Fearing that Sargeras' spirit would linger on, Aegwynn locked the ruined husk of his body within one of the ancient halls of Kalimdor that had been blasted to the bottom of the sea when the Well of Eternity collapsed.\n\nAegwynn would never know that she had done exactly as Sargeras had planned. She had inadvertently sealed the fate of the mortal world, for Sargeras, at the time of his corporeal death, had transferred his spirit into Aegwynn's weakened body.

In that age, there were many dragonflights.\n\nYet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the Titans chose to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the Pantheon imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. These majestic dragons (as listed below) became known as the Great Aspects, or the Dragon Aspects.\n\nAman'Thul, the Highfather of the Pantheon, bestowed a portion of his cosmic power upon the massive bronze dragon, Nozdormu. The Highfather empowered Nozdormu to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. The stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One.\n\nEonar, the Titan patron of all life, gave a portion of her power to the red leviathan, Alexstrasza. Ever after, Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, and she would work to safeguard all living creatures within the world. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.\n\nEonar also blessed Alexstrasza's younger sister, the lithe green dragon Ysera, with a portion of nature's influence. Ysera fell into an eternal trance, bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Known as the Dreamer, she would watch over the growing wilds of the world from her verdant realm, the Emerald Dream.\n\nNorgannon, the Titan lore keeper and master-magician, granted the blue dragon, Malygos, a portion of his vast power.

The great-hearted Neltharion, known afterwards as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as Alexstrasza's greatest supporter.\n\nThus empowered, the Five Aspects were charged with the world's defense in the Titans' absence.

While the trolls were able to roam and control the large areas of their jungle empire, the sea eluded them. It was vast and immeasurable, no doubt a disconcerting neighbor for the powerful trolls.\n\nIt should be noted here that recent discoveries seem to suggest that the trolls had little interest in exploring the lands beyond the Great Sea. While troll species have been encountered along the length and breadth of Azeroth, Khaz Modan and Lordaeron, little evidence of their civilization has been found in the newly discovered lands of Kalimdor or upon the islands in the South Seas. Whether this demonstrates an unwillingness of the trolls to venture away from their terrestrial holdings or a failure on their part to develop the technologies needed to make such a journey will take further research and analysis that is out of the scope of my writings here.\n\nBut one can hardly ignore so large a presence, and new findings in the extensive troll ruins of Stranglethorn Vale show an aspect of their relationship with the sea previously unknown and undocumented.\n\nTHE STONE OF THE TIDES\n\nRecent discoveries during surveys of the troll ruins of Stranglethorn Vale have shown references to an object known as the \"Stone of the Tides\". Various fragments of troll legends can be pieced together to paint a rather complete picture of the Stone and its importance to the ancient Gurubashi Empire.\n\nIt appears that the Stone of the Tides allowed its bearer to control water in its many forms, rivers, rain, and the tides. Because of the stories related to use of the Stone of the Tides, I have conjectured that it is actually a physical manifestation of the powers of the Waterlord, a powerful elemental of the seas. How and why such an object would leave the Waterlord's control and fall into the hands of the trolls is another question that is beyond the scope of my knowledge.\n\nTHE TIDEBEARER\n\nLike the movements of the eponymous tides, the Stone of the Tides entered the world of the trolls and departed, never constantly staying in the trolls' hands for longer than a generation at a time.\n\nIn troll legends, it is said that the first time the Stone of the Tides came to the Gurubashi Empire, it was found by a troll warrior wandering along the coast of Stranglethorn. He came upon a mysterious blue stone within which milky white strands floated and flowed. Intrigued by the stone, the warrior took it with him and continued upon his journey.\n\nOver the weeks and months, the warrior discovered that the stone had given him control over water. He could summon forth water elementals, creatures formed completely of water--duplicating a feat that only powerful mages of the Kirin Tor are able to perform.\n\nThe warrior traveled to Zul'Gurub, to the heart of the empire, to show his newfound abilities to the Emperor. He easily gained a court audience after demonstrating his powers in the center of the Imperial capital. His powers easily amazed the Gurubashi Emperor, who immediately gave him a place of honor at court, naming the warrior \"Tidebearer\", leaving his old name behind.\n\nFor years, the Tidebearer served the Gurubashi Empire, summoning his thrall water elementals in battle and manipulating the flow of water in Stranglethorn Vale for the benefit of the Empire. But as the years went on, the Tidebearer became more reclusive, tending to stay for long periods of time away from court.\n\nThe Tidebearer was hiding a secret from the prying eyes of court. The abilities granted to him by the Stone of the Tides also came with a curse. As the years passed, the Tidebearer was fading away. With each coming and going of the tides, the Tidebearer became less of himself, losing his corporeal form--pulsing in and out of existence--until in his dying days, he traveled to the beach where he had first found the Stone, and walked into the sea, disappearing for the last time.\n\nGenerations later, the Stone of the Tides washed upon the shores of Stranglethorn, and another Tidebearer was chosen, as the troll brought the Stone to Zul'Gurub. So the process continued for generations, the Stone appearing with the tide, and the Tidebearer leaving into the tide.\n\nModern day accounts of the Stone of the Tides have appeared from place to place, but one must still wonder why an object of such power would appear with such regularity, and by whose design.", "authors": ["Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver "]}, {"id": "14456", "title": "Sunreaver Orders", "text": "You must meet with Magister Hathorel inside The Filthy Animal.

Convinced that the Horde would overcome all of humanity if left unchecked, the leaders of the seven human nations met and agreed to unite in what would become known as the Alliance of Lordaeron.\n\nFor the first time in nearly three thousand years, the disparate nations of Arathor were once again united under a common banner. Appointed as Supreme Commander of the Alliance forces, Lord Lothar prepared his armies for the coming of the Horde.\n\nAided by his lieutenants, Uther the Lightbringer, Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, and Turalyon, Lothar was able to convince Lordaeron's demi-human races of the impending threat as well. The Alliance succeeded in gaining the support of the stoic dwarves of Ironforge and a small number of high elves of Quel'Thalas.\n\nThe elves, led at that time by Anasterian Sunstrider, were largely uninterested in the coming conflict. However, they were duty-bound to aid Lothar because he was the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline, which had aided the elves in ages past.\n\nThe Horde, now led by Warchief Doomhammer, brought in ogres from its homeworld of Draenor and conscripted the disenfranchised Amani forest trolls into its fold. Setting out on a massive campaign to overrun the dwarf kingdom of Khaz Modan and the southern reaches of Lordaeron, the Horde effortlessly decimated all opposition.\n\nThe epic battles of the Second War ranged from large-scale naval skirmishes to massive aerial dogfights. Somehow the Horde had unearthed a powerful artifact known as the Demon Soul and used it to enslave the ancient Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza. Threatening to destroy her precious eggs, the Horde forced Alexstrasza to send her grown children to war. The noble red dragons were forced to fight for the Horde, and fight they did.\n\nThe war raged across the continents of Khaz Modan, Lordaeron, and Azeroth itself. As part of its northern campaign, the Horde succeeded in burning down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, thereby ensuring the elves' final commitment to the Alliance's cause. The greater cities and townships of Lordaeron were razed and devastated by the conflict. Despite the absence of reinforcements and overwhelming odds, Lothar and his allies succeeded in holding their enemies at bay.\n\nHowever, during the final days of the Second War, as the Horde's victory over the Alliance seemed almost assured, a terrible feud erupted between the two most powerful orcs on Azeroth. As Doomhammer prepared his final assault against the Capital City of Lordaeron - an assault that would have crushed the last remnants of the Alliance - Gul'dan and his followers abandoned their posts and set out to sea.\n\nThe bewildered Doomhammer, having lost nearly half of his standing forces to Gul'dan's treachery, was forced to pull back and forsake his greatest chance at victory over the Alliance.\n\nThe power-hungry Gul'dan, obsessed with obtaining godhood itself, set out on a desperate search for the undersea Tomb of Sargeras that he believed held the secrets of ultimate power. Having already doomed his fellow orcs to become the slaves of the Burning Legion, Gul'dan thought nothing of his supposed duty to Doomhammer.\n\nBacked by the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans, Gul'dan succeeded in raising the Tomb of Sargeras from the sea floor. However, when he opened the ancient, flooded vault, he found only crazed demons awaiting him.\n\nSeeking to punish the wayward orcs for their costly betrayal, Doomhammer sent his forces to kill Gul'dan and bring the renegades back into the fold. For his recklessness, Gul'dan was torn apart by the maddened demons he had set loose. With their leader dead, the renegade clans quickly fell before Doomhammer's enraged legions.\n\nThough the rebellion had been quelled, the Horde was unable to recoup the terrible losses it had suffered. Gul'dan's betrayal had afforded the Alliance not only hope, but also time to regroup and retaliate.\n\nLord Lothar, seeing that the Horde was fracturing from within, gathered the last of his forces and pushed Doomhammer south, back into the shattered heartland of Stormwind. There, the Alliance forces trapped the retreating Horde within the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire. Though Lord Lothar fell in battle at the Spire's base, his lieutenant, Turalyon, rallied the Alliance forces at the eleventh hour and drove the Horde back into the abysmal Swamp of Sorrows.\n\nTuralyon's forces succeeded in destroying the Dark Portal, the mystical gateway that connected the orcs to their homeworld of Draenor. Cut off from its reinforcements and fractured by infighting, the Horde finally buckled in upon itself and fell before the might of the Alliance.\n\nThe scattered orc clans were quickly rounded up and placed within guarded internment camps. Though it seemed that the Horde had been defeated for good, some remained highly skeptical that peace would last. Khadgar, now an Archmage of some renown, convinced the Alliance high command to build the fortress of Nethergarde that would watch over the ruins of the Dark Portal and ensure that there would be no further invasions from Draenor.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14490", "title": "Letter to Ello", "text": "The letters on this note seem to flicker and dance across its surface.

Known for humble yet hardworking residents, Darrowshire stayed in the background of Lordaeron history until the Second War.\n\nHeroes were made during that war. And heroes were lost.\n\nThe Battle of Darrowshire\n\nThe Battle of Darrowshire took place in the middle of the Second War, when scourge forces rampaged across Lordaeron. Darrowshire was cut off from the bulk of Alliance forces, but the town was bolstered by a company of troops, a contingent of paladins of the Silver Hand, and a staunch group of local militia led by Captain Joseph Redpath.\n\nThe Scourge's first assaults on Darrowshire were sparse. Small groups of marauding skeletons and corpses wandered the outskirts of the village and were repelled. But the Scourge were not balked by the defenders' tenacity, and responded in kind; soon after the first wave of attacks a second wave emerged. Champion ghouls, servants of the ghoul lord Horgus, screamed down from the hills and clashed with beleaguered Darrowshire defenders.\n\nThe Defenders weakened, but were relieved by paladins, disciples of the Silver Hand. Their leader, Davil Crokford, was a native of Darrowshire. He brought his followers to the village when he heard of the impending attack, and together with the defenders they held back the servants of Horgus.\n\nWhen Horgus himself entered the battle, he met with Davil. For many minutes they fought and Davil eventually prevailed, but he suffered a mortal wound and died soon after defeating the ghoul lord.\n\nThe battle continued, and Captain Redpath led his militia bravely. And it might have been won, had the captain not been corrupted by the death knight Marduk the Black.\n\nIn the middle of the fray Marduk rode up to Redpath, and with black magic he tore loose Redpath's spirit, twisting it into an evil shadow of the brave captain.\n\nThe corrupted Captain Redpath then spread his evil taint among the defenders of Darrowshire, who betrayed their allies and slaughtered them. They then turned on the town of Darrowshire and killed all who hid in their homes.\n\nThe remaining scourge army, along with the corrupted spirit of Captain Redpath, then left the ravaged village of Darrowshire and tore into Lordaeron, adding to the pain and death of the Second War.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14492", "title": "Brazie's Notes On Naughty Night Elves", "text": "Let's be honest.

These elementals, who worshipped a race of unfathomably evil beings known only as the Old Gods, vowed to drive the Titans back and keep their world inviolate from the invaders' metallic touch.\n\nThe Pantheon, disturbed by the Old Gods' penchant for evil, waged war upon the elementals and their dark masters. The Old Gods' armies were led by the most powerful elemental lieutenants: Ragnaros the Firelord, Therazane the Stonemother, Al'Akir the Windlord, and Neptulon the Tidehunter.\n\nTheir chaotic forces raged across the face of the world and clashed with the colossal Titans. Though the elementals were powerful beyond mortal comprehension, their combined forces could not stop the mighty Titans.

Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil.

His words fell on deaf ears, however, as stronger chieftains such as Grom Hellscream of the Warsong clan stepped forward to champion the new age of warfare and dominance.\n\nKil'jaeden knew that the orc clans were almost ready, but he needed to be certain of their ultimate loyalty.

Before I could cock my rifle, Erlgadin raised his crossbow and fired upon the beast.  The bolt missed its mark and caught the beast heavily in the left flank.  The tiger made a futile attempt to flee but its wound was too grave.  The beast stumbled for a few tragic seconds until Barnil finished the kill with a thrown axe.\n\nThe kill brought about a festive mood amongst the expedition. Barnil poured mead for all to enjoy. But our festivities were short-lived. As we were preparing the corpse for transport back to base camp we were all caught off guard by a horrendous growl. In all my years I have never heard anything so blood curdling.\n\nOn a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon.  I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground.  He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.\n\nWe gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.\n\nI had promised the expedition that we would spend the next day hunting panthers, as their furs are in high demand throughout Azeroth.  It only makes sense that such demand should exist with all of the able-bodied hunters, trappers and fur-traders off giving their lives so valiantly in the name of the Alliance.\n\nAjeck and Sir Erlgadin were anxious to learn how to hunt effectively with a Dwarven Rifle.  I had the two humans leave their primitive range weapons at base camp.  Barnil and I outfitted them with some of Ironforge's finest firearms.\n\nOn this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks.  Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge.  I could not help but to think of Brann's descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel.  So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.\n\nBefore long, Ajeck tracked the panther to the southwest.  We walked quietly, guns at the ready, in anticipation of our prey.  A snapping of twigs from a nearby copse of trees drew our attention immediately.  Something was in there. One stern glance at Barnil was enough to convey my thoughts.  Barnil slowly lowered his rifle.  This kill was not for us; it was for our Human companions.  Countless panthers had lost their lives in front of our smoking barrels.  This kill would be for the Humans.\n\nBoth Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.\n\n", "authors": ["Hemet Nesingwary "]}, {"id": "14523", "title": "Scout's Journal", "text": "I've found an incredible site!\n\nThe whole area pulsates with the hum of ancient architecture.\n\nIf it were not so late in the day, I would investigate the chamber immediately!\n\nSleeping, tonight, will be a struggle...\n\nA most productive day, today!\n\nThe chamber is indeed of ancient origin, and houses a magnificent mechanism which seems to be in disrepair.\n\nI will investigate further tomorrow.\n\nThis discovery will surely force Schnottz to take notice of me!\n\nHow could he deny me a promotion after something like this?\n\nIt has taken me all day to wrestle the cipher from these hieroglyphs: Through eyes of blue is starlight revealed.

Famine and terror were commonplace within the broken kingdoms. The Gurubashi trolls, driven to desperate ends, sought aid from ancient, mystical forces. Though both of the troll kingdoms shared a central belief in a great pantheon of primitive gods, the Gurubashi fell under the sway of the darkest one.\n\nHakkar the Soulflayer, a vile, bloodthirsty spirit, heard the trolls' call and decided to aid them. Hakkar gave his secrets of blood to the Gurubashi and helped them extend their civilization across most of Stranglethorn Vale and certain islands of the South Seas. Though he brought them great power, Hakkar wanted more and more for his efforts.\n\nThe bloodthirsty god demanded souls be sacrificed to him daily. He dreamed of gaining access to the physical world so he could devour the blood of all mortal creatures. In time the Gurubashi realized what kind of creature they had courted with -- and turned against him. The strongest tribes rose up against Hakkar and his loyal priests -- the Atal'ai.\n\nThe terrible war that ensued between Hakkar's followers and the rest of the Gurubashi tribes is spoken of only in whispers. The budding empire was shattered by the magic unleashed between the angry god and his rebel children. Just as the battle seemed most hopeless, the trolls succeeded in destroying Hakkar's avatar and banishing him from the world.\n\nEven his Atal'ai priests were eventually driven from the capital of Zul'Gurub and forced to survive in the uncharted swamplands to the north. Within those shadowy fens they built a great temple to their fallen god -- Atal'Hakkar -- where they could continue to do their master's work...\n\nThe rest of the Gurubashi tribes went their separate ways after the great civil war had left their lands in ruins.

Gilneas, Alterac, and Kul Tiras were the first city-states to arise, and although they each had their own customs and commercial workings, they all held to the unifying authority of Strom.\n\nUnder the vigilant watch of the Order of Tirisfal, Dalaran became the chief center of learning for magicians throughout the land. The Magocrats who ruled Dalaran founded the Kirin Tor, a specialized sect that was charged with cataloguing and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known to mankind at the time.\n\nGilneas and Alterac became strong supporters of Strom and developed mighty armies that explored the mountainous southern lands of Khaz Modan. It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of Ironforge. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling.\n\nThe city-state of Kul Tiras, founded upon a large island south of Lordaeron, developed a prosperous economy based on fishing and shipping. Over time, Kul Tiras built up a mighty fleet of merchant vessels that sailed throughout the known lands in search of exotic goods to trade and sell. Yet even as the economy of Arathor flourished, its strongest elements began to disintegrate.\n\nIn time, the lords of Strom sought to move their estates to the lush northlands of Lordaeron and leave the arid lands of the south. The heirs of King Thoradin, the last descendants of the Arathi bloodline, argued that Strom should not be abandoned and thus incurred the displeasure of the greater citizenry, who were likewise eager to leave.\n\nThe lords of Strom, seeking to find purity and enlightenment in the untamed north, decided to leave their ancient city behind. Far to the north of Dalaran, the lords of Strom built a new city-state which they named Lordaeron. The entire continent would take its name from this city-state. Lordaeron became a mecca for religious travelers and all those who sought inner peace and security.\n\nThe descendents of the Arathi, left within the crumbling walls of ancient Strom, decided to travel south past the rocky mountains of Khaz Modan. Their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name Azeroth. In a fertile valley they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right.\n\nThe few warriors still left in Strom decided to remain and guard the ancient walls of their city. Strom was no longer the center of the empire, but it developed into a new nation known as Stromgarde. Though each of the city-states became prosperous in its own right, the empire of Arathor had effectively disintegrated. As each nation developed its own customs and beliefs, they became increasingly segregated from one another.

Though you have already saved these former companions of mine, it would be my conjecture that repugnant echoes of the evil that once twisted their spirits still linger at those haunted loci. Such was the malevolent power of Lord Valthalak's spirit.\n\nAdditionally, the brazier can be used to summon forth Lord Valathalak, though as before, extreme caution should be taken in doing so.\n\nThe brazier itself functions just as the Brazier of Beckoning did. Simply place it within range of any of the five haunted loci and it will invoke the spirits of the dead.\n\nAs a side note, because I know that you'll be interested in knowing, the Banner of Provocation can be used in similar fashion at the arena in Blackrock Depths. Be sure to teach Theldren and his goons a lesson for me every time you get a chance when you're there.\n\nRead on should you desire further enlightment.\n\nISALIEN\n\nNight Elven Priestess of the Moon\n\nWhen Isalien decided to take her leave of the company, she did so with the intention of making a pilgrimage to Dire Maul, the fallen, ancestral night elven city once known as Eldre'Thalas. Therein still stands a library of great knowledge, a sanctum that a small number of night elves have been able to hold back the tide from. She was intent upon finding answers both to her heritage and possibly concerning the amulet pieces. It should be noted that she was also a good friend of Falrin Treeshaper.\n\nUnfortunately, as she and her companion hippogryph, Empyrean, were entering the city, they were assailed by Alzzin the Wildshaper and his minions. There she fell, never to rise again. Perhaps it is for the best that Isalien never unlocked any further secrets from the evil magic that Lord Valthalak put into containing a portion of his essence in the amulet.\n\nThe open-aired chamber where Alzzin resides is one of these haunted loci.\n\nMOR GRAYHOOF\n\nTauren Druid and First to Fall\n\nMor Grayhoof was ever a stalwart and trusted companion within The Veiled Blade. It is unfortunate that he was the first to fall to Lord Valthalak's evil minions.\n\nAs we fled from Valthalak, we were being pursued by a veritable army of his spectral assassins and stalkers. The flight from Blackrock Spire was chaotic, to say the least. Unfortunately along the way, Mor somehow lost his footing, though I suspect that he was pushed. In any case, he fell down in to the recesses of the lower portion of the spire.\n\nLater, we discovered that Mor had actually survived the fall. But there was to be no happy ending for my good friend; he was taken prisoner by the trolls of Tazz'Alaor. Not long after, as he was being tortured by War Master Voone, a group of Valthalak's assassins jumped in and finished the job.\n\nShould you seek to raise the echo of Mor Grayhoof's spirit, War Master Voone's chamber is a haunted location.\n\nJARIEN AND SOTHOS\n\nSiblings and would-be members of the Scarlet Crusade\n\nJarien and Sothos were two of the most intolerant people that I knew. Yet their skills as combatants were exceptional, and they came from money, which I suppose is why Anthion, the leader of The Veiled Blade, kept them on.\n\nThe siblings eventually found themselves enamored with the teachings and philosophy of the Scarlet Crusade. They had always exhibited a certain zeal in vanquishing any of the Scourge that we ran across in our travels, and it was suspected that their family had ties to the organization.\n\nSo it was that they found themselves facing the trials that are required of those that seek to join the Crusade. Of particular interest to them was a position of knighthood within the ranks; something that required more difficult testing apparently. For it was later discovered that Sothos actually failed his final test. Jarien would not have it though, and in open defiance she insisted that he be able to join her amongst the knights. From what we have gathered, Grand Crusader Dathrohan slew them both right on the spot in the middle of his chambers.\n\nThus it is that another of these haunted loci is The Crimson Throne inside The Scarlet Bastion at Stratholme.\n\nKORMOK\n\nTwo-Headed Ogre Necromancer\n\nWhat can be said about Kormok? He was a two-headed ogre of the caster variety who didn't used to be all that bad. When we first took him into the fold it was as a prisoner on some job we'd accepted in Burning Steppes. He proved himself invaluable in helping us to get out of a sticky situation we fell into there, however, and so he came on as one of the company's premier mages.\n\nThe odd thing about him though was the completely different nature of his two heads. One was always cheerful if not a little foolish, while the other was sly, calculating and had an almost dead look to its eyes. Kind of creepy really.\n\nLater, through the course of our travels, Kormok became exposed to the necromantic side of magic. Unfortunately the creepy head exhibited an affinity for raising dead spirits, and took a perverse pleasure in it, especially in summoning forth the exiled spirits of Purgation Isle to do his bidding.\n\nAfter the company disbanded, Kormok enrolled at the Scholomance to further his 'education'. The spectral assassins found entrance to the school all too easy, and slew him right there in front of his new master, Ras Frostwhisper.\n\nThis makes Ras Frostwhisper's chamber one of the haunted locations where the brazier can be successfully utilized.\n\nLORD VALTHALAK\n\nDraconid Noble and former General of Blackrock Spire\n\nBefore General Drakkisath, there was Lord Valthalak, a draconid warlock of immense power. It is common for the leadership of the Spire to change hands, and unfortunately for us, we were going to play a part in the latest shift in power.\n\nWe'd been commissioned by a goblin smuggler-wizard out of Booty Bay, Gremnik Rizzlesprang, to steal Valthalak's spellbook. We don't know if he wanted to study it or sell it (or both), and it doesn't matter now. What does matter is that we infiltrated the upper reaches of Blackrock Spire and slew Lord Valthalak in his lair. That's when the fun really began.\n\nWe had no idea of the depths of Valthalak's magical knowledge where soul-manipulation was concerned, or we probably would never have taken on the job in the first place. But take it we did, and it proved to be the last job we ever would take.\n\nHaving slain Lord Valthalak, and taken his spellbook, Kormok must have sensed something about his amulet. He insisted on taking it as his share of the loot, which quickly devolved into a heated argument, and almost a fight, over the thing. We didn't know at the time that the amulet actually housed a good portion of Valthalak's spirit; we found that out later, much to our displeasure.\n\nSplitting the amulet into pieces, we fled from the newly risen ghost of Valthalak, as well his army of spectral assassins. And the noise we made fighting over the amulet had roused a number of the Spire's remaining defenders!\n\nAlmost all of us made it out of Blackrock and thought we were safe. But, even from the beyond, Valthalak sent his minions at us no matter where we hid. The Veiled Blade soon broke apart after that mission, and then we were really easy pickings.\n\nAs you must know, this makes Lord Valthalak's abode, what is now The Beast's chamber in Blackrock Spire, the last of the haunted locations.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14531", "title": "Damp Diary Page (Day 512)", "text": "Diary - Day 512\n\nThe bananas have started talking to me and I have learned a great deal about their culture.

I'm, um, lactose intolerant.\"\n\nTanda placed the cheese back in the bowl. \"Oh, are you sure? Does that mean you can't tolerate me?\" The buxxom tauren stepped forward, pressing herself against Marcus. The substantial height difference placed his face squarely in her chest. Unable to see, he flailed in protest, finally finding purchase on her firm backside -- his muffled apologetic sounds only made her giggle and squeeze him more tightly.\n\nJust as his other hand found her tail, the light dimmed as an imposing figure moved into the doorway. \"What the...\"\n\nTanda exclaimed, \"Bax, no!\"\n\nMarcus pulled his head away and gasped for air, looking at the angry tauren with wide eyes. \"It's not what it looks like!\"\n\nBax charged, ramming into Marcus while uttering his challenge, \"You mess with the bull, you get the horns!\"\n\nMarcus reeled and caught himself, digging his heel into the dirt. Seizing a horn in each hand, he held the tauren's head down, fighting against his tremendous strength. Bax forced his head up, grunting and spitting in anger, only to have it repeatedly pushed down. They locked eyes for a moment, and with a final heave of explosive force, Bax wrenched himself free.\n\nThe powerful tauren swung his arms out wide, as if to crush Marcus in a mighty hug. \"Blades of Light!\" proclaimed the paladin. A huge, pulsing sword thrust up from the ground between the two combatants, tearing through armor and clothing, searing the thick chest hair of Marcus and cutting a fine line into the tauren's muscular chest.\n\nBefore they could move again, Tanda raised her hooved leg into the air and brought it down with warlike force. The man and bull wobbled, clearly stunned. \"Stop it, both of you!\"\n\nMarcus regained his composure and looked at Tanda, and then to Bax. Fur was ruffled and the bare parts of their leathery skin glistened with sweat.

The juice from the fruit went drip, drip, drip upon the stone as one turned to the other and cawed.\n\n\"What does it say? What is he reading?\" asked Muninn.\n\nHuginn bobbed his head up and down, peering intently with one eye at the rune stone below.\n\n\"I cannot read!\" the large raven exclaimed. \"You know this. Why do you taunt me?\" Huginn pecked in frustration at his companion.\n\nMuninn defecated, missing the vrykul below by mere inches.\n\n\"We should get him to fashion us something. An eye... caw!\" Muninn insisted.\n\nHuginn agreed with his own caw as the vrykul peered up at the two ravens whom only he could understand.\n\n\"If you two will give me some peace, I will make you something that will let you read anything your little bird brains desire,\" Havi said. \"Now be quiet.\"\n\n...\n\nTime passed, but differently for the ravens as it does for all immortals. They spent centuries reading everything they could get their hands on through the lens of their precious Raven's Eye. Countless days were spent deciphering old, weatherworn runic carvings in languages long since dead. They were happy. Well, as happy as ravens can be, which is to say, no one believes that they can ever truly be happy. Not even ravens.\n\nThen the day came when the stranger arrived. An elf, one of those new kaldorei, the night elves as everyone else was referring to them. The little people were always so much more annoying than the vrykul. But somehow, this one was different. And he had something in his hand that was the sweetest smelling thing they had ever experienced.\n\n\"What is that you have there, my fine-feathered friends,\" the bearded kaldorei asked.\n\n\"Caw!\" was the reply that he received, as only their master could understand them. But, the power of the Raven's Eye allowed them to understand him perfectly. They had long ago learned all of the languages of the small mortal races.\n\n\"The three of us share something in common, for my name is Ravencrest. You might say we are kin after a fashion,\" the night elf explained, his voice strangely soothing. \"May I try to read that tablet? It looks awfully interesting.\" And with that, the elf slowly edged a little closer to see the runes written upon the stone.\n\nHuginn and Muninn were transfixed by the smell of whatever mysterious delight this Ravencrest held in his closed fist. Their heads bobbed up and done uncontrollable to try to get just the slightest peek at what it might be. They let him move closer.\n\nWhat danger could a mere elf pose?\n\nThe night elf's brow furrowed and he frowned. He was staring at the tablet that the ravens had been reading, a funny story about a stupid little boy and girl who were tricked by a clever vrykul witch and then eaten.\n\n\"Alas, I cannot read this. I do not know the ancient runes of the honorable and proud vrykul people,\" the Ravencrest confessed. He sighed loudly and his shoulders slumped. \"I know that ravens are the smartest of all Azeroth's creatures, but how is it that the two of you can read this timeworn scrawl?\" he coyly asked.\n\nMuninn, ever the suspicious one, pierced the stranger with a look from this left eye, only darting a quick glance once or twice, perhaps three times, at the elf's closed hand to make certain that whatever was in there had not disappeared.\n\nBut, before the doubtful bird could stop him, his more trusting brother gave their secret away. Huginn rapped three times upon their most prized possession. Despite the sharpness of the raven's beak, no scratch marred the facets of the perfect, magical jewel.\n\n\"Oh, how wonderful! Are you saying that bauble allows you to read the stone?\" the sly elf queried. The two birds sat staring at him, their chests puffing up and their hackles rising.\n\n\"No, no, friends, you mistake me. I only wish to borrow your jewel. Please, let me use it to read the runes,\" the elf requested.\" After, we can all have a lively discussion about whatever story is written upon the stone. In return, I will give you this.\"\n\nThe Ravencrest finally revealed what he had been concealing within his hand. To the ravens, it was perhaps the most amazing thing they had ever seen or smelled, second only to Havi's jewel.\n\nSlowly, the kaldorei placed the hard piece of elven candy on a nearby rock. The ravens twisted their heads back and forth between the jewel, the elf, and the treat. But, it was not long before their nature overtook them and they hopped over to the rock. The candy was delicious, better than anything they had ever eaten, even the food of the gods within the Halls of Valor.

It seemed that the fragile pact that had forged the human nations together in their darkest hour would break at any given moment.\n\nAmidst the political turmoil, many of the camp wardens began to notice an unsettling change come over their orc captives. The orcs' efforts to escape from the camps or even fight amongst themselves had greatly decreased in frequency over time. The orcs were becoming increasingly aloof and lethargic.\n\nThough it was difficult to believe, the orcs - once held as the most aggressive race ever seen on Azeroth - had completely lost their will to fight. The strange lethargy confounded the Alliance leaders and continued to take its toll on the rapidly weakening orcs.\n\nSome speculated that some strange disease, contractible only by orcs, brought about the baffling lethargy. But Archmage Antonidas of Dalaran posed a different hypothesis. Researching what little he could find of orcish history, Antonidas learned that the orcs had been under the crippling influence of demonic power for generations.\n\nHe speculated that the orcs had been corrupted by these powers even before their first invasion of Azeroth. Clearly, demons had spiked the orcs' blood, and in turn the brutes had been granted unnaturally heightened strength, endurance, and aggression.\n\nAntonidas theorized that the orcs' communal lethargy was not actually a disease, but a consequence of racial withdrawal from the volatile warlock magics that had made them fearsome, bloodlusted warriors.\n\nThough the symptoms were clear, Antonidas was unable to find a cure for the orcs' present condition. Then too, many of his fellow mages, as well as a few notable Alliance leaders, argued that finding a cure for the orcs would be an imprudent venture.

Apparently, he was some big shot gladiator way back when, and the bosses didn't like that because he never stopped winning. So they did what any good businessman would do - they poisoned him before a big fight.\"\n\n\"Even poisoned, the guy wasn't a pushover and took out several ogres before he fell. They thought they had taken care of him, but I guess death wasn't enough to put him down. Before they knew it, his spirit would show up at matches and kill off all the fighters, ruining a lot of bets in the process.\n\n\"So the ogres called in one of their shaman to sort the spirit out. Turns out the spirit of Gutrek was trapped up in his weapon, which they kept on display at the arena. At the recommendation of the shaman, the ogres took the weapon to some secret place, broke it down into pieces, and scattered the pieces throughout Nagrand.\"\n\n\"Nobody seems to know where the pieces are now, or what someone would need to do to get them back together, but if this thing is as powerful as they say I smell big profts!\"\n\nSecond Entry:\n\n\"Last night I managed to \"borrow\" some of the writings from the shaman who helped quell the spirit of Gutrek. I didn't have it for long, but I was able to jot down some notes about the location of the pieces of his weapon:\n\n\"The pommel was brought to the Broken Precipice, where it was to be housed in the skull of Gutrek's first kill. It looks like it was some manner of large beast that he fought in the big bone pit.\"\n\n\"The hilt was to be buried in the marshlands, among the serpents whose poison claimed Gutrek's life. There's something there about covering it with a spiral stone, which is supposed to keep the spirit at bay somehow.\n\n\"The final piece, Gutrek's blade, was to be displayed in a place of honor for all time overlooking the Ring of Blood. I don't think I've seen it there myself, but it says it's supposed to be somewhere where it has a clear view of every battle.\n\n\"Still no mention of how it was dismantled or how it can be remade, though...\"\n\nThird Entry:\n\n\"I'm convinced that the secret location where the ogres broke down Gutrek's Cleaver is the key to remaking it from the pieces. Otherwise, why wouldn't they just break it down like any other weapon? \n\n\"Unfortunately, nobody's quite sure where this place is, only that it's called the Spirit Forge and that it was overrun by gronn some time ago.

There is a mystery to some of the events that occurred not too long ago, and hopefully I will be able to unravel some of it in order to help my people.\n\nLet me start by putting down facts so they don't slip my mind at a later date.\n\nI've recently found truth to the rumors of the wizard Dartol's efforts.\n\nWhere once I thought it preposterous that a human would come to our lands and learn our ways, this wizard, this evil man, came here and not only survived, but also gained some of our knowledge. I'm still uncertain how...\n\nI never discovered his goals during my investigation, but his plan seemed simple: using druidic magic, he wanted to befriend and then control the furbolg. If it was in an attempt to harm my kin, or for some other malicious purpose, I hope to find out before my path ends.\n\nRegardless, he was apparently more successful than naught in actualizing his plans. Did he want to attempt his machinations on the furbolg before trying on my people? Did the furbolg have something he coveted? Who knows?\n\nUsing an item he created (a rod or staff of some kind), he attempted to infiltrate the furbolg tribes of Ashenvale. At some point, and this is where many of the details are still unclear, he was discovered by the furbolg while trying to manipulate them into acting against one another. As I'm sure the elves would be, the furbolg were angered, but they reacted much more strongly and killed Dartol.\n\nThe furbolg, at least at this time, weren't the same corrupted creatures they've become. They were still rational and intelligent--their relationship with our people amicable.\n\nI'm hoping that if I can recreate the rod with the help of a dryad named Shael'dryn, I can use its power to help our people... and the furbolg.\n\nNot all the furbolg have been corrupted. Some still live and try to protect the forest. During their corruption, some of the furbolg fled, many were killed, and others were forced out of their tribes.\n\nI found a venerable furbolg of the Foulweald tribe living above Lake Mystral--his name is Krolg.\n\nI've watched him for days, and I think if I were to approach him in the guise of a furbolg, I could help him and discover a way to re-establish a bond between our people.\n\nAlong with killing Dartol, the furbolg split up the rod into three parts so it couldn't be used against them again. It has been difficult, but I've a good idea where all three parts were placed.\n\nThe Gem\n\nThe first part of the rod, a glowing gem, was hidden in a shrine in Northwestern Ashenvale. I believe now this shrine is the ruins at the center of Lake Falathim. The Sentinels told me that it was inhabited by murlocs, but my initial scouting has uncovered something far more strange and insidious.\n\nIf I can't find the gem hidden in the shrine, it might be in the possession of one of the strange tendrils or eyes emerging from below.\n\nThe shaft portion\n\nThis part of the rod was given to the treants near what is now called Felwood. Neither the furbolg nor my kind could have suspected that such magnificent creatures could ever fall to the corruption that's overtaken the land.\n\nMy research tells me that the guardians kept the piece in a small glade locked within a chest. To find out any more, I'll have to speak to Shael'dryn.\n\nShael'dryn is a dryad who protects the moonwell northeast of Lake Iris. She refuses to leave the forest or forsake it to the corruption. I know she has the power and knowledge to repair the rod, or to at least tell me how I can do it on my own.\n\nThe pommel\n\nThe pommel of the rod was given to the druids of Dor'danil. There is one major problem with this though: the druids are dead.\n\nTheir spirits now inhabit the area and are no longer hospitable.\n\nThis may require more investigation. I'm not sure I'm powerful enough to fight the spirits of my dead kin...let alone delve into the depths of Dor'danil and find the pommel.\n\n(Note: During my preparations in Astranaar, I've recently met a dwarf hunter who has spent a good portion of his time in Ashenvale trying to help my people. He came from a place called Stormwind.\n\nWe spoke over a few ales one night, and his tales have given me new hope of finding the pommel...\n\nHe tells me he's been throughout all of Dor'danil, and he's never seen a chest or any container that may hold the pommel. He also tells me that rotting slimes have inhabited the area, and they devour almost anything smaller than them. He's seen them \"eat\" tables, sculptures, bears, and even gnomes!\n\nThe slimes seem to gain a great deal of sustenance from things magical. If the chest holding the pommel was enchanted at all, the slimes might have eaten it.\n\nIt's a gamble, but I have no other clues at this time...As I find out more I'll put the details here; but until then, I shall work on finding the parts of the rod and helping Ashenvale.", "authors": ["Teronis "]}, {"id": "14561", "title": "Kodo Skin Scroll", "text": "To face Frostmaw, you must entice him with the meat of his favorite prey.\n\nGo to the Alterac Mountains in Azeroth and hunt a hulking mountain lion.

Though Sargeras and his Legion had been ripped from the world by the Well's destruction, Malfurion and his companions were left to ponder the terrible cost of victory.\n\nThere were many Highborne who did survive the cataclysm unscathed. They made their way to the shores of the new land along with the other night elves. Though Malfurion mistrusted the Highborne's motivations, he was satisfied that they could cause no real mischief without the Well's energies.\n\nAs the weary mass of night elves landed upon the shores of the new land, they found that the holy mountain, Hyjal, had survived the catastrophe. Seeking to establish a new home for themselves, Malfurion and the night elves climbed the slopes of Hyjal and reached its windswept summit. As they descended into the wooded bowl, nestled between the mountain's enormous peaks, they found a small, tranquil lake. To their horror, they found that the lake's waters had been fouled by magic.\n\nIllidan, having survived the Sundering as well, had reached Hyjal summit long before Malfurion and the night elves.

The exultant Illidan, believing that the new Well was a gift to future generations, was shocked when Malfurion hunted him down. Malfurion explained to his brother that magic was innately chaotic and that its use would inevitably lead to widespread corruption and strife. Still, Illidan refused to relinquish his magical powers.\n\nKnowing full well where Illidan's ruthless schemes would eventually lead, Malfurion decided to deal with his power-crazed brother once and for all. With Cenarius' help, Malfurion sealed Illidan within a vast underground barrow prison, where he would remain chained and powerless until the end of time. To ensure his brother's containment, Malfurion empowered the young warden, Maiev Shadowsong, to be Illidan's personal jailor.\n\nConcerned that destroying the new Well might bring about an even greater catastrophe, the night elves resolved to leave it be.

Do not attempt any step of your ritual without all of these implements. Each is essential.\n\nWithin the next pages, I will describe how each implement must be used.\n\nCircle of Greater Binding\n\nA Circle of Greater Binding must be created at a site where magic is strong. There is such a place deep in the ruins of Eldre'Thalas, also called Dire Maul. In Eldre'Thalas there is imprisoned a being of great power, Immol'thar; it is on the pedestal of his prison where you must perform the ritual to create the Circle.\n\nFight your way to the Pedestal, then let J'eevee out of his jar.\n\nThe Bell, the Wheel and the Candle\n\nAfter releasing J'eevee he will then place the Bell, the Wheel and the Candle, and a circle will appear. This is the start of the ritual. You must be vigilant; the aforementioned objects conduct vast energies and are prone to failing. When this happens you must quickly use your Black Lodestone to restart them before your entire ritual fails.\n\nIf all three objects have failed before you can restart them, then your ritual ends and you must begin it anew.\n\nIn addition to conducting the energies of the ritual, the Bell, Wheel and Candle have unique properties of their own.\n\nThe Bell of Dethmoora, when ringing, bestows warlocks in the circle with vigor and energy.\n\nThe Wheel of the Black March, when spinning, protects those in the circle from harm.\n\nThe Doomsday Candle, when burning, sends eldritch energy at foes who enter the circle.\n\nBecause of these blessings, it is very important to keep all of these objects working during the ritual.\n\nIt must also be noted that the Black Lodestone, used to restart the Bell, Wheel or Candle if they fail, requires soul shards. Each time you restart a ritual object with the Lodestone one of your soul shards will be consumed, so be sure to have a large stock of them before the ritual begins.\n\nCompleting the Ritual\n\nYou can track your progress by the magic runes along the border of the circle. When nine runes appear then the ritual is complete, and you will see energy rise from the newly empowered Circle.\n\nFrom there, you may invoke the Xorothian Glyphs and open a portal into Xoroth and pull a dreadsteed through it.\n\nDefeat the dreadsteed and release his spirit.

There were twin troll empires -- the Gurubashi Empire of the southeastern jungles -- and the Amani Empire of the middle forestlands.\n\nThere were smaller tribes that lived far to the north (in the region now known as Northrend). These tribes founded a small nation known as Gundrak, but never achieved the size or prosperity of the southern empires.\n\nThe Gurubashi and Amani empires had little love for one another, but rarely warred against each other. At the time, their greatest common enemy was a third empire -- the civilization of Azj'Aqir. The aqir were intelligent insectoids who ruled the lands of the far west. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionistic and incredibly evil. The aqir were obsessed with eradicating all non-insect life from the fields of Kalimdor.\n\nThe trolls fought them for many thousands of years, but never succeeded in winning a true victory over the aqir. Eventually, due to the troll's persistence, the aqiri kingdom split in half as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent.\n\nTwo aqiri city-states emerged -- Azjol-Nerub in the northern wastes, and Ahn'Qiraj in the southern desert. Though the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified.\n\nWith the insectoids driven into exile, the twin troll empires returned to business as usual. Despite their great victory, neither civilization expanded much farther than their original boundaries. However, ancient texts speak of a small faction of trolls that broke off from the Amani Empire and founded their own colony in the heart of the dark continent.\n\nThere, these brave pioneers discovered the cosmic Well of Eternity which transformed them into beings of immense power.

At last! After all of my years of prayers and good deeds, the cleansing of the blight of the unliving from the face of Azeroth. After all of the failures and resurrections.\n\nFinally!\n\nIt happened again. \"Come to me...\", the Light commanded.\n\nI woke up freezing, but it wasn't cold in my chambers. I'm going to redouble my efforts! I'll tell the high abbot tomorrow that I want prayers increased. No more half-measures!\n\nThe Holy Light has taken notice of our good work. I can feel it!\n\nThis time I was awake! It was very vivid, and yet for over a minute, in the middle of the warm, sunny day, my breath came out misted and chill. One of the priests noticed and dropped to his knees in prayer.\n\nNo one else heard the voice, though. At least the witness proves that I'm not going insane. Maybe I should ask Landgren to pray on the matter?I'll get Jordan and Street to scrutinize their recruiting efforts tomorrow. We've grown bloated with ranks of unbelievers who yearn only to destroy the undead. That's not enough!\n\nThe commander and the bishop were both receptive. Not that they had any choice. Bishop Street in particular seemed very enthusiastic. He spoke of a revival for the crusade and swore to ferret out the weak of faith within our ranks.\n\nI told him to go easy. I've no intention of destroying the Crusade. However, I do like the sound of forming an elite cadre of the most faithful to do the Light's bidding in Northrend. I fear the man's friendship with Le\n\nCraft is slowly twisting him. They both have their uses, though.\n\nI will leave most of the Crusade here to continue mopping-up operations on the undead in our backyard. I imagine that once they have finished what we began, most will disband and go back to their homes to live in peace.\n\nThat somehow seems right. At our finest, we have always been the salt of the earth, rising up to take back our homes from the filth of the Scourge corruption, to return our Lordaeron to its former glory. To a time before the Scourge, before Arthas and regicide... before the Lich King.\n\nThere have been whispers amongst the men about a day soon to come that will change everything for the Scarlet Crusade. Bishop Street has put a name to it, calling it the Crimson Dawn.\n\nI will put some thought to this, though I can feel the truth of it in my bones. I pray that it will bring weal for us rather than woe.\n\nThe Light has spoken again with a great deal of urgency. I came away from the dream with a sense of impatience. I will not disappoint. There must be no more delays. We must soon be underway!\n\nWhat a great coincidence then - and I had to control myself from showing my relief - this afternoon Captain Shely procured for us a number of new ships for the voyage. Perhaps it was no coincidence at all? The Holy Light expresses its will in ways that we are not meant to understand.\n\nI will take the Sinner's Folly as my flag. I think the name is most fitting.\n\nNow I know why the Light has been pushing me to be underway. In the dead of night a Scourge necropolis appeared in the sky over us and out poured the minions of hell!\n\nA new breed of death knight leads the assault. Already the casualties we've suffered have been catastrophic. With the Scourge able to strike at us anywhere and at will from above, there seems no way to mount a proper defense.\n\nI fear that our intended expedition to Northrend is over before it has begun.\n\nI've been informed that Hearthglen and the surrounding area have already begun to assemble a host. High Commander Galvar Pureblood himself intends to lead them to save us. His efforts will be for naught.\n\nI must see to it that my best couriers get through the enemy lines and warn him off. Hearthglen must prepare to dig in and rally the rest of the Crusade.\n\nWith any luck they'll get through before nightfall.\n\nThere's been no word from any of my couriers this morning. It's clear that none of them made it through to Hearthglen. The Plaguelands are lost. Pureblood will come with his forces and they'll be annihilated out in the open.\n\nThis afternoon I received a vision from the Light. In it, I saw the utter destruction of everything that we've built here. The message was clear - I was being told to take the remainder of the most faithful and abandon the Crusade to their doom.\n\nLandgren later told me that he'd received the same vision. I cannot comprehend how the Light would tell us to take such a dishonorable action, but it is not my place to question - I am to obey, and obey I shall.\n\nIt was with trepidation that I gazed upon New Avalon, I suspect for the last time. Our fate lies in Northrend. I am filled with a sense of ominous foreboding for some reason. The mission ahead should shake away these concerns. I will put them out of my mind.\n\nPerhaps with luck, High Commander Pureblood will somehow endure and marshal the survivors. I'm a coward - a dog running away with my tail tucked between my legs!\n\nTwo months they tell me that this journey is going to take. The other ships aren't built for speed like the Folly. They're carrying most of our forces and equipment, and they're not much more than single sail freighters, but they'll get there safely.\n\nI'm not looking forward to this, but for the Light I will endure the sea sickness. I simply mustn't let the others see.\n\nI've not written in a while. It's as much as I can do to stand upright and not get sick. The men are beginning to wonder why I keep myself holed up in my cabin most of the time. It wouldn't be good for morale for them to see me this way.\n\nIt shouldn't be long now. I pray that it won't be. Six weeks already and every day it seems that the weather gets worse. I can only hope that Northrend itself does not have such horrible weather. I wasn't built for the cold.\n\nThe Holy Light has been silent for a very long time.\n\nWe were attacked with no warning whatsoever! Giants in massive oared longships came out of the mist like ghosts! They were silent as the dead.\n\nI lost a ship and all of the men on it. We fought with great courage and skill considering that we have only the most rudimentary naval combat training.\n\nAfterward, the screams of our men who'd been taken captive by the giants echoed across the water. After a while it grew silent again. Bishop Street led the men in prayers.\n\nI awoke this morning in the middle of making adjustments to my maps. The Light was guiding my hand, showing me exactly where we must go.\n\nWe are close!\n\nLandfall!\n\nExiting the rowboat upon the beach, I planted our banner and was overcome by the Holy Light, which spoke through me. Today is the Crimson Dawn - the great day that we've waited for. This is to be the site of New Hearthglen. We are no longer the Scarlet Crusade. We are now the Scarlet Onslaught!\n\nAnd an onslaught upon Northrend we shall be! The cancer of the Scourge threatens to overflow in the crown of the world and drown the rest of us. The time has come to take the fight directly to the Lich King's doorstep!\n\nIt's been almost a month now and construction has proceeded apace. I've been too busy to write. My scouts tell me that this land is full of dragons and other strange beasts. We'll keep to ourselves until we're ready.\n\nIn the middle of services today, the high abbot proclaimed that a visitor would arrive soon - one that the Light was sending to lead us to victory.\n\nI don't know how I feel about that. Why didn't the Light tell me? Have I not served faithfully? Now I'm to be replaced by some outsider?\n\nAdmiral Barean Westwind showed up on my doorstep tonight! By all accounts he'd died upon these shores an age ago.\n\nHe didn't look old enough and yet I knew that it was him. He claimed that he was the only survivor of his doomed fleet and that he'd survived only through the good graces of the Light.\n\nWe stayed up speaking through the night and into the morning. He assured me that he had no intention of taking my place, but that the Light had instructed him to travel across the Great Dragonblight to serve as my advisor and commander in title only. He claimed that great change was coming to Northrend. The Alliance and the Horde were going to come en masse in response to a great plague that the Lich King was about to unleash upon them.\n\nThe men have taken to the grand admiral with great zeal, especially High Abbot Landgren and Bishop Street. Apparently the Holy Light whispered a new blessing to the admiral in his sleep, which he passed on to Landgren. Some of the men have converted to the priesthood and are now being called \"raven priests\".Only Jordan seems unimpressed. I suppose that's understandable. He probably feels his position is threatened if mine is.\n\nSomething doesn't seem right. I can't put my finger on it, but I cannot make myself fully trust the admiral. He's done nothing wrong. Quite the contrary! And yet, I have to trust my gut.\n\nI will pray for understanding. The Light delivered the admiral to lead us to victory and it is not my place to question its decisions. I will continue to obey. I am faithful.\n\nAnother couple of months have passed. We've made great strides in the construction of New Hearthglen. The wall is almost complete as is the barracks. Kaleiki's men are miracle workers.\n\nMy heart hasn't been into writing. I've been avoiding putting my thoughts here for some reason. The Light hasn't visited me of late, though the admiral assures me that this is nothing to worry about.\n\nMy men report that a small group of Forsaken have broken ground on a camp along the hillside to the north. On the other side of the hill, the Alliance have apparently begun the construction of a much larger base.\n\nThe admiral says that we should leave them be. There are other Horde forces gathered to the west that would surely come to their aid if we were to attack. I don't feel good about it, but I see the logic in his reasoning.\n\nThe first phase of construction is done. Admiral Westwind has ordered a group of my men to establish a toehold further to the north. He wouldn't go into detail, claiming that he was being \"guided\" to do so.\n\nWe caught four spies from the Forsaken town, Venomspite, this afternoon.

Some are acts of valor and self-sacrifice. Others are tales of strength and conquest.\n\nI have made it my quest to seek out these stories and collect them, for I am not a warrior. But when I asked myself where to begin, I knew it had to be with Odyn. Even the greatest tale of vrykul excellence is eclipsed by his deeds. Walk the land and you will hear brave warriors recount his legends with awe. If we vrykul are to reach our true potential, it is surely by following in Odyn's path.\n\nTake heed, then, of what follows. Many of these tales are from Odyn's own tongue, faithfully transcribed by the vrykul story-weavers who have come before me.\n\nGreat Odyn and the Firelord\n\nWhy does Odyn, warrior of iron and bronze, bear the brand of the Firelord on his chin? Old Brynjar will tell you! Every vrykul with a head still on their shoulders knows the story of mighty Odyn and the Firelord. But there is no tale that greater shows the keeper's unfailing strength, his undying courage, and his incredible honor than that of mighty Odyn's beard.\n\nIn an age before Odyn raised the vrykul to eternal glory, he and his fellow keeper, the valiant Tyr, waged war on the elemental lord Ragnaros. Together they ventured to the behemoth's charred domain to destroy him, cutting down his molten army like wheat before the scythe, and the Firelord ran in fear from the formidable champions. He thought to hide from the keepers in his lair, but wherever he fled, Odyn and Tyr followed, laying waste to Ragnaros's realm.\n\nInside the lair of the Firelord, an inferno roiled and raged, bolstering the elemental's might. \"I am empowered!\" cried proud Ragnaros. \"Approach me, insects, if you dare!\"\n\nHow arrogant the Firelord was. How foolish to challenge the keepers of Azeroth!\n\nOdyn was too full of courage, too pure of heart, to be shaken by such hollow threats. The keeper struck at the Firelord with the strength of a thousand vrykul, raining down upon Ragnaros with piercing spears of light while Tyr lashed out with his silver hammer, and soon the pitiful Firelord was on the verge of defeat.\n\n\"Clearly Ragnaros is no match for our strength, brother,\" said Tyr. \"I hope you will not be dismayed when I land the final blow.\"\n\nOdyn laughed. \"Ha! I would sooner fall to the Firelord!\"\n\nAnd with that, the two great warriors set upon Ragnaros, each wishing to best the other. After hearing their wager, the pathetic Firelord called down smoke as black as night to surround his weakened form. Neither keeper could find their foe until Tyr, wielding his shining hammer like a torch, cut through the darkness and struck Ragnaros to the core. Yet before he could fell the Firelord, fresh gouts of flame erupted from Ragnaros's maw, driving Tyr back.\n\nOur great Odyn was not so easily defeated. \"Let the Firelord strike me!\" Odyn said. \"I am the chosen of Aman'Thul! None, not even this supposed lord, can best my might.\" Thus Odyn ran at Ragnaros, engulfing himself in the inferno and smiting the Firelord with a single blow.\n\nEven as he fell, Ragnaros's flame washed over Odyn and set the keeper's face ablaze with the fury of the Firelord. Again mighty Odyn laughed, shaking the very heart of the world with his mirth. Where once his beard had been, there now raged a sea of molten rock and fire!\n\n\"Brother,\" Tyr cried, \"forget our wager! You have been scarred by the Firelord! How shall we ever heal your wounds?\" \n\n\"You only say such things because I have bested you, Tyr. Leave it be!\" Odyn declared. \"Now all will know that I have defeated the Firelord, for his might is no match for my own!\"\n\n-Recorded by Old Brynjar\n\nThe Wanderer and the Serpent\n\nLong after the Shadow, long before the Breaking, Odyn sat as Prime Designate of all things. Keepers and titan-forged alike obeyed his fair and just rule, for there was none greater than he. Odyn often walked the world to watch over his servants. He did so disguised as one of them, wanting to see how they truly lived. \"The respect a warrior shows a stranger reveals the true measure of his valor,\" Odyn once said.\n\nSometimes he took the form of an earthen. Sometimes, a giant or a vrykul. No matter what he appeared as, he always had a raven perched on each shoulder. He could peer through the birds' eyes and see the good in someone's heart. He could listen through their ears and hear when someone was spinning lies.\n\nMany titan-forged he met on his sojourns, and just as many he judged to be noble. Yet above all others, he found himself drawn to the vrykul.\n\nIn the form of a vrykul, Odyn sparred with their warriors, sang with their story-weavers, and shaped metal with their smiths. \"These vrykul are like me,\" he said. \"Warriors, courageous and unyielding.\"\n\nIt was during this time when the ice-blue serpent Ysildar slithered up from the black pits of the earth and hunted the vrykul. So terrible was this beast that when it stretched to its full length, its tail disappeared over the horizon. It could devour a dozen vrykul at once, crushing their metal bodies with its obsidian fangs. Some say Ysildar was one of Keeper Freya's animal followers, gone mad with rage. Others say it was a thing far more ancient and unspeakable, a nightmare born in the era of Shadow.\n\nOdyn feared for the vrykul. He was prepared to cast off his disguise and battle the beast himself, but he found he had no need to. The vrykul fought as one. They pried back Ysildar's iron-like scales and stabbed at its flesh. They took out its eyes and blunted its fangs.\n\n\"How mighty were the vrykul,\" Odyn said of that day. \"How fearless were their hearts.\"\n\nYet Ysildar was no ordinary monster, and even the vrykul could not vanquish it for good. So Odyn hurried to the tip of the serpent's tail. No vrykul had traveled so far. Alone, Odyn took on his true form, seized Ysildar's tail, and with a mighty swing, hurled the beast skyward. The serpent flew so high that it passed across the sun and made day into night. It sailed over mountains and rivers, over forests and swamps. Some days later, it landed in the sea and sank into the cold depths. \n\nYsildar was never seen again.\n\n-Recorded by Kormyr Sylfverhan\n\nHalls of Gold and Glory\n\nTwo vrykul warriors once argued over how the Halls of Valor came to be. One of them believed the stronghold had been carved by the hands of the first vrykul who ever walked the world. The other claimed that the halls had existed before that, since the time Azeroth was born.\n\nTheir bickering went on and on until another vrykul descended on the wings of a storm drake to settle the dispute. Not with violence, but with words. His voice carried the weight of a mountain, and he calmed the angry vrykul and set them straight with this story:\n\n\"You are both mistaken about the Halls of Valor. Listen well, and I will tell you the right of it. The halls arose before the Breaking, when the titan-forged had grown weak and indifferent. They were tired from the war against the Shadow and from the rebuilding of this world. Who can blame them for wanting a bit of rest?\n\n\"The other keepers, all except Odyn, had lost faith in themselves. You see, they believed they could no longer protect the world on their own, and so they decided to anoint the proto-dragons as guardians instead. They would give those beasts godlike power and trust that they would use it wisely.\n\n\"Fools! How could they trust such things? The proto-dragons carried the blood of elementals, those mindless creatures that had served evil in the time of Shadow. No matter how noble the proto-dragons seemed, were their hearts not tainted with darkness? Odyn believed it to be so. 'Trust in these winged beasts,' he said to the other keepers, 'and a day will come when they will abandon their sacred duty! But empower the vrykul as protectors instead, and you will witness true valor and strength.'\n\n\"And what did the other keepers say to that? Not a word worth repeating. They ignored Odyn's wisdom, and they granted power to those blasted proto-dragons. The creatures grew in size and strength that day. They became the Dragon Aspects, and their children became known as dragons.\n\n\"Yes, Odyn was hurt, but he was not resentful. Pay no heed to stories that claim otherwise. He simply feared for the world's future and for the safety of its creatures. \n\n\"There was another who shared this fear, of course, the sorceress called Helya. She stood by Odyn's side when all others turned their backs on him. A true ally, that one. Odyn and Helya decided to empower the vrykul on their own and create an army to guard the world when the primitive dragons failed.\n\n\"The other keepers hissed and stamped their feet in protest. Ha! Surely they were jealous they had not thought of Odyn's plan first. Three times he extended the hand of peace and gave them a chance to help. Three times the other keepers turned him down, too proud to accept his gracious offer.\n\n\"Odyn and Helya soon began their work. They chose a wing of the great fortress of Ulduar, and they asked the earth giants to reshape its halls and cover it in gold. So was made the Halls of Valor, a place where the keeper and the sorceress could bring their vrykul warriors.\n\n\"When the giants finished their labors, Helya sang a spell to make the place as light as a cloud. The halls rose into the sky and drifted through the heavens, Odyn and the sorceress watching from the walls.\"\n\nWith the tale told, the strange vrykul took wing on his storm drake and flew into the skies. The feuding warriors ended their fight, for they could feel in their bones that the stranger had spoken truth.\n\n-Recorded by Yrvar Isilmar\n\nThe Keeper's Eye\n\nThere are more stories about Odyn's lost eye than there are stars in the sky. Some say the great serpent Ysildar tore it out. Others say the treacherous Helya stole it. But this is the end of it, the truth of it, from the keeper himself.\n\nThe Halls of Valor stood glorious above the world, and great Odyn saw they were empty. \"These halls shall be the final resting place of my finest warriors,\" he said. \"I must see the world of death, for only then can I raise the spirits of the fiercest, bravest vrykul to their proper place in the heavens. They shall be called Valarjar, and they shall honor these halls for eons to come.\"\n\nHelya the sorceress was doubtful of the keeper's plan. \"Beings of death are ancient and powerful, great Odyn,\" she said. \"To meddle in their realm is dangerous, even for one such as you.\" But Odyn would not be swayed, and so they began a ritual to see into the Shadowlands.\n\nDeep within the Halls of Valor, Helya traced a magic circle around Odyn with the arcane threads of the universe. From the world's energies she pulled strands of light of the purest green, and strands of darkness deeper than the purest shadow. And the sorceress wove them together around Odyn until the veil over the Shadowlands began to lift.\n\nA great spirit appeared to Odyn from this circle, billowing up from ethereal mists, shapeless, to surround the keeper in shadow. \"What will you give,\" the spirit asked, \"to peer beyond the veil of this world?\"\n\nWise Odyn considered the wraith's question. \"I have two eyes,\" he replied. \"One to see in this world of mortals, and one to see into the realm of spirits.\" And with that, Odyn plucked his own eye from his head and presented it to the spirit. The spirit clasped his eye and swallowed it whole, and great Odyn saw.\n\nSeeing through this given eye, great Odyn saw the Shadowlands. He saw life, saw it even in the land of death, and he was satisfied that his Valarjar would live beyond the mortal realm. \nAnd yet still he saw death. He saw souls in torment, and souls in anguish, and the husks of the dead lay all around him. He saw ghostly wraiths with no face, and others with no form, and all were made of death itself. And as he saw, even the great Odyn, master of the Halls of Valor, chosen of Aman'Thul, was afraid.\n\nOdyn looked back into his world with his other eye. \n\n\"What did you see, great Odyn?\" Helya asked. \n\n\"I saw the answer,\" wise Odyn said. \"For in life, there exists death, and in death, there can be life. But there are only beings of life and beings of death. My messengers must span both realms.\"\n\nAnd so great Odyn conceived the Val'kyr, beings between life and death who would ferry the vrykul to the Halls of Valor. \"They will be formed from the vrykul,\" Odyn proclaimed, \"and their bravery shall preserve their brethren as Valarjar for all time. Like life, they shall be powerful. Like death, they shall be eternal.\"\n\n-Recorded by Rysa Hjafmir\n\nFirst of the Val'kyr\n\nHow did the first Val'kyr come to be? Take care not to ask this of Odyn unless you seek his wrath. Only once has the keeper answered this question, and the skies turned black and the seas churned and frothed under the weight of his words.\n\nNot long after the sorceress Helya lifted the Halls of Valor into the heavens, Odyn decided how he would bring the souls of worthy vrykul warriors to his domain. He would call on living vrykul to help him. These servants would sacrifice their mortal lives to become something greater, creatures called Val'kyr, who would walk between life and death to guide the souls to the halls.\n\nWell, Helya was not keen on this idea. The thought of transforming living vrykul into such beings was too much for her to bear. She demanded that Odyn reconsider his plans. If he did not, Helya threatened to bring the Halls of Valor crashing to the ground in fire and brimstone.\n\nWhere had such ire come from? Not even Odyn was sure, but he had his theories. Perhaps Helya was jealous he had not asked her to become the first Val'kyr. Or perhaps something truly dark and sinister had taken root in her heart. After all, Helya had studied the Shadowlands and their powers. Had an unknown force from that cursed realm reached out and poisoned her mind? \n\nOdyn pleaded with Helya to change her mind, but she only slipped deeper into rage. She howled a song-spell to cast the halls from the sky, and the keeper had little choice but to take action against her.\n\nOh, what a terrible battle it was that followed. You might be wondering how any creature could stand against great Odyn. Well, Helya was a force of reckoning. It was not Odyn who defeated the sorceress, but her own arrogance. So desperate to win was Helya that she reached into the Shadowlands to grasp that domain's power for herself. And in return, she was sucked into that dread realm. She would have been lost forever had Odyn not put his own life at risk and pulled her to safety.\n\nWhen he brought her back to the realm of the living, he was stunned by what he saw, by what had become of dear Helya. Her body had crumbled away, and all that remained was a twisted wraith. Odyn was heartbroken. He could not send her back to the Shadowlands to dwell in eternal torment, nor could he let her roam free on the physical world and terrorize mortal-kind.\n\nThe answer to this problem came from Helya herself. Her journey into the Shadowlands had humbled her. She apologized to Odyn for what she had done, and she pleaded with him to make her into a Val'kyr. It was through service to the Halls of Valor that she sought redemption.\n\nThough his heart was heavy, Odyn granted Helya's wish. And so was born the first of the Val'kyr.\nNow, there are many tales out there that claim Odyn forced Helya to become Val'kyr against her will. Only a fool would believe such things. This story comes from Odyn himself, and how could anyone hold another's word above his?\n\n-Recorded by Kormyr Sylfverhan\n\nThe Sealing of the Halls of Valor\n\nIt is told, in the small hours of vrykul nights, how the mighty keeper Odyn came to be imprisoned within the Halls of Valor-the very halls he himself had shaped. Most claim that he was betrayed by the first Val'kyr, the sorceress Helya, and they are correct. (May she burn for her treachery!) But few are aware of the dark truth behind her foul misdeed. Let it be told now.\n\nIn penance for her earlier rebellion against Odyn, Helya became the first Val'kyr, and she spent millennia bringing the souls of heroic vrykul to the Halls of Valor, where the keeper trained them and turned them into Valarjar-warriors of the storm. His followers filled Odyn with pride, for they were the finest fighters Azeroth had ever known, and they protected the world ferociously.\n\nHelya served Odyn well and faithfully, regaining his trust and confidence...\n\nBut the serpent-tongued manipulator Loken, hungering to ascend to primacy and rule over all other keepers-in fact, to rule over all the world-knew that to succeed, he would have to eliminate Odyn and his Valarjar. And so he came to Odyn's most trusted servant, Helya, and played on her mind, planting suspicion and discontent with her position, convincing her that Odyn had used her to perpetuate his own power and glory. \n\nThen Loken the trickster played his master stroke, proposing a bargain: if Helya would do as he asked, he would restore her free will. (\"For why else would you be Odyn's slave unless he had tricked you into believing that you obeyed him of your own accord?\") Helya was stunned, for she had thought she was serving Odyn willingly. But Loken convinced her that in fact Odyn had secretly bound her to serve his will. Now the furnace of her rage was stoked, and Helya agreed to seal off the Halls of Valor from the rest of Azeroth forever in revenge.\n\nAnd Loken smiled when he saw how readily Helya rose to his suggestion that once Odyn and his followers were trapped, she could assume the mighty keeper's position as the caretaker of all vrykul spirits!\n\nThusly Loken beguiled the sorceress to leave the protection of Odyn's wisdom-for what other possible reason could Helya have so callously betrayed Odyn? When her master least expected it, she called upon all her arcane might and bent the cataclysmic energies swirling around Azeroth to her will, sealing off the Halls of Valor and all who dwelt within!\n\nLoken was now free to work his wiles on the rest of the keepers. And as for Helya, having escaped her servitude, she took command of the other Val'kyr. But unable to abide the sight of the golden halls, for they reminded her always of her treachery, she created a new home far below, bound to Azeroth's oceans, which became known as Helheim. \n\n-Recorded by Halsvir Fjinnsonn\n\n", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14809", "title": "The Twin Empires", "text": "About 16,000 years ago (long before the night elves foolishly called down the wrath of the Burning Legion), trolls lorded over much of Kalimdor (then a single continent). There were twin troll empires -- the Gurubashi Empire of the southeastern jungles -- and the Amani Empire of the middle forestlands.\n\nThere were smaller tribes that lived far to the north (in the region now known as Northrend). These tribes founded a small nation known as Gundrak, but never achieved the size or prosperity of the southern empires.\n\nThe Gurubashi and Amani empires had little love for one another, but rarely warred against each other. At the time, their greatest common enemy was a third empire -- the civilization of Azj'Aqir. The aqir were intelligent insectoids who ruled the lands of the far west. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionistic and incredibly evil. The aqir were obsessed with eradicating all non-insect life from the fields of Kalimdor.\n\nThe trolls fought them for many thousands of years, but never succeeded in winning a true victory over the aqir. Eventually, due to the troll's persistence, the aqiri kingdom split in half as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent.\n\nTwo aqiri city-states emerged -- Azjol-Nerub in the northern wastes, and Ahn'Qiraj in the southern desert. Though the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified.\n\nWith the insectoids driven into exile, the twin troll empires returned to business as usual.

However, ancient texts speak of a small faction of trolls that broke off from the Amani Empire and founded their own colony in the heart of the dark continent.\n\nThere, these brave pioneers discovered the cosmic Well of Eternity which transformed them into beings of immense power.

For hundreds of years, Guardian Aegwynn used this greatstaff to defend Azeroth from the Burning Legion.\n\nYet that alone is not what makes this weapon unique. An entity of pure arcane energy known as Aluneth is bound to the greatstaff. Harnessing this unruly being and its power requires tremendous precision and focus. An ordinary mage could never hope to control Aluneth. \n\nFortunately, you are no ordinary mage.\n\nAluneth, Part One\n\nThe wise and mirthful blue dragons were the first creatures on Azeroth to discover Aluneth. While manipulating the fabric of reality, they tapped into another realm of existence and made contact with the strange arcane entity. \n\nThe blue dragons loved unraveling mysteries and delving into the secrets of the universe. They were so intrigued by Aluneth's existence that they summoned the entity into the world for further study.\n\nAluneth immediately went on a rampage through the blue dragons' lair, the Nexus. The arcane presence destroyed countless rare artifacts and tomes of power before finally being contained. The dragons were not angry about what had happened--they were delighted by Aluneth's capricious nature.\n\nAfter years of conducting harmless experiments on Aluneth, the blue dragons satisfied their curiosity and sent the entity back to its own realm.\n\nAluneth, Part Two\n\nFrom chapter forty-three of Ancient Magic and How to Wield It Without Destroying the World:\n\n\"And so we come to the story of the Highborne named Meitre and the source of his power, Aluneth. Few subjects are as hotly debated. Last year alone, five magi were treated for severe burns after their discussion of Meitre escalated into a fiery brawl. Let us put the rumors to rest and focus on the facts.\n\n\"Meitre lived during the height of the night elf empire, and he was one of his race's most gifted sorcerers. As the story goes, he spent years exploring the world in search of knowledge. His extensive travels brought him into contact with an unknown blue dragon, from whom Meitre discovered the existence of the arcane being named Aluneth and the otherworldly plane where it dwelled.\n\n\"The sorcerer never enslaved Aluneth--the being was far too strong and unwieldy for that. Yet Meitre found a way to draw power from the entity, thereby using its energies to enhance his own spells.\"\n\nAluneth, Part Three\n\nFrom chapter fifty of Ancient Magic and How to Wield It Without Destroying the World, concerning the Burning Legion's first invasion of Azeroth:\n\n\"Most Highborne sorcerers sided with the Burning Legion and used their powers to help the demons invade the world. Meitre did not. He joined the night elf resistance and fought to defend the world. It was during these troubling years that Meitre mastered his connection with Aluneth.\n\n\"In one battle, he and a group of night elf defenders found themselves surrounded by an overwhelming force of demons. Death was imminent, but Meitre did not abandon hope. He called on Aluneth's energies and wove a mass teleportation spell that transported him and his comrades to safety.\n\n\"Let this be a lesson that what makes magi great is not only their ability to destroy but their ability to save lives. True wisdom is knowing the right time to use one instead of the other.\"\n\nAluneth, Part Four\n\nFrom chapter sixty-one of Ancient Magic and How to Wield It Without Destroying the World, concerning the aftermath of the War of the Ancients:\n\n\"Following their victory over the Legion, the night elves outlawed the use of arcane magic. They believed that the sorcerous arts were not safe and that wielding them would only lead to another disaster like the War of the Ancients.\n\n\"Meitre could not give up magic. Doing so would mean breaking his connection with Aluneth. The sorcerer quailed at the thought of losing his ability to draw on the entity's power. Perhaps he lacked confidence in his own skills. Whatever the case, Meitre retreated from society and became a recluse.\"\n\nAluneth, Part Five\n\nNo one knows exactly what became of Meitre, but he left behind a wealth of scrolls that would form the basis of modern magic. His writings included a number of spells that the sorcerer had created himself.\n\nEven thousands of years after the War of the Ancients, high elf and human magi continued learning from Meitre's knowledge. The ability to cast spells from his scrolls was seen as an important milestone in a young apprentice's education, and a measure of a pupil's aptitude.\n\nThough many magi delved into Meitre's scrolls, no one knew of Aluneth. The entity that had played such a critical role in the sorcerer's life was forgotten... until the time of Guardian Aegwynn.\n\nAluneth, Part Six\n\nAegwynn was the Guardian of Tirisfal, a sorceress imbued with extraordinary power and charged with protecting Azeroth from the Burning Legion.\n\nLike all magi of her era, Aegwynn was familiar with Meitre and his scrolls. During her apprenticeship, she had mastered the ancient elf's spells much earlier than the other students.\n\nSomething had always perplexed Aegwynn about Meitre. While studying his writings, she realized that the elf had wielded immense power-more than any regular sorcerer should have been capable of. After Aegwynn inherited the mantle of Guardian, she became obsessed with finding out how.\n\nAegwynn discovered a series of lost scrolls written by Meitre. They described Aluneth in detail, and even included spells the elf had used to tap into the being's power.\n\nAluneth, Part Seven\n\nGuardian Aegwynn believed she could use Aluneth as a formidable weapon against the Burning Legion. Yet unlike Meitre, she would not simply tap into the entity's energies; she would bring the being into Azeroth and bind it to her will.\n\nAegwynn summoned Aluneth with ease, but it would not obey her commands. The fickle creature thrashed against the Guardian's containment magics and nullified her spellwork. Aegwynn reveled in the challenge of taming Aluneth. After many setbacks, Aegwynn finally bound the entity to an enchanted greatstaff. The task of containing Aluneth was done, but it would take the Guardian years to truly harness its power.\n\nAluneth, Part Eight\n\nAn excerpt from Fire in the North: The Battle between Aegwynn and Sargeras, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Of all the trials Aegwynn faced, of all the foes she fought, none rivaled Sargeras. In the frozen wastes of Northrend, the Guardian confronted the ruler of the Burning Legion. \n\n\"This was not Sargeras in his true form, only an avatar containing a portion of his strength. Even so, Aegwynn's opponent was powerful beyond measure.\n\n\"Aegwynn raised Aluneth high and called down a storm of arcane magic to annihilate Sargeras. Nothing happened. The entity bound to Aegwynn's weapon resisted her command. As she struggled to assert her will over Aluneth, Sargeras launched a furious assault against the Guardian.\n\n\"Ultimately, Aegwynn put Aluneth aside and opted for a more reliable weapon. She summoned Atiesh, a mighty staff passed from Guardian to Guardian, and renewed her attack against Sargeras.\"\n\nAluneth, Part Nine\n\nThough Aegwynn defeated Sargeras, the battle changed her forever. \n\nUnbeknownst to the Guardian, the Legion's ruler had transferred a portion of his spirit into her soul. Aegwynn's demeanor darkened. As the years passed, she grew suspicious of the Council of Tirisfal, the order of magi that had imbued her with power and given her the mantle of Guardian. \n\nTo distance herself from the council, Aegwynn used Aluneth to forge a secret refuge. \n\nAtop a nexus of magical ley lines that coursed through Azeroth, the Guardian crafted her spell. She harnessed the full potential of Aluneth's energies, and reality warped and shifted around Aegwynn. \n\nLegend has it that a great tower then rose from the earth. It would become known as Karazhan.\n\nAluneth, Part Ten\n\nFor centuries, Aegwynn strengthened her control over Aluneth. She dispatched the Legion's demons with ease and secured Azeroth's safety for generations. \n\nAegwynn eventually gave birth to a boy named Medivh, who would become the next Guardian. In time, Aegwynn planned to bequeath Aluneth to her son, but that day would never come.\n\nThe spirit of Sargeras had passed from Aegwynn to Medivh. Over many long years, the demon lord twisted the new Guardian's thoughts. Sargeras used Medivh to help the mighty orcish Horde invade Azeroth and bring war to the world.\n\nAluneth, Part Eleven\n\nAn excerpt from The Fate of Aegwynn, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"When Aegwynn learned of Medivh's actions, she confronted him. Mother and child unleashed the full fury of their magics upon each other in a battle that would decide Azeroth's future.\n\n\"Even with Aluneth at her command, Aegwynn could not best Medivh. She only narrowly survived her encounter with the corrupted Guardian.\n\n\"Medivh was later vanquished, but that brought Aegwynn little solace. She was tormented by what had become of her son-by the darkness that she had unwittingly passed to him. For a time, Aegwynn retreated from society, and she entrusted Aluneth to the Kirin Tor of Dalaran.\n\n\"To prevent anyone from abusing Aluneth's power, the Kirin Tor locked the greatstaff away. For years, it would remain in an enchanted vault, under the watchful eyes of blue dragons.\"\n\nFelo'melorn\n\nFelo'melorn. Flamestrike. Sword of kings. Bane of trolls.

It stands as a symbol of hope, loss, and power-of destruction and renewal.\n\nThose who have wielded Felo'melorn have forever etched their names into history. Will you do the same?\n\nFelo'melorn, Part One\n\nThough it is not known for certain, rumors that have passed down through generations suggest that a young Dath'Remar Sunstrider, who would one day become king of the high elves, dreamed of the weapon Felo'melorn. In that dream, the arcane blade burned like the sun and dispatched so many enemies that it created a swift-flowing river of blood. \n\nDath'Remar would later recount the specifics of the blade's appearance to the renowned magesmith Luminarian as he crafted the weapon on his arcane forge.\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Two\n\nFrom the personal writings of Serena Everwind, night elf priestess during the War of the Ancients:\n\n\"Dath'Remar wielded Felo'melorn, Flamestrike, like an elf possessed. He was an unstoppable force, at once majestic and graceful yet savage and deadly. The runes of the blade seemed to pulse in rhythm with the pounding of Dath'Remar's fierce heart as he separated limb from body and head from shoulders. \n\n\"When the fighting was done, Dath'Remar stood painted in demon blood. As night fell, we knew that more battles remained, and yet, with this elf and this blade among us, we held out hope that victory did not lie beyond our grasp.\"\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Three\n\nIn the hands of Anasterian Sunstrider, great-grandson of the high elf king Dath'Remar, Felo'melorn became a legendary troll-killer. \n\nAmong the trolls, whispers spread of a spellbound blade, empowered by arcane magic not only to slay the most formidable and cunning of its enemies, but also to cut through superior numbers and irrigate battlefields with their blood. \n\nTroll witch doctors set about casting hexes and curses against the infamous weapon, but history bears out that even the darkest voodoo did little to negate the effectiveness of Felo'melorn during the Troll Wars.\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Four\n\nAn account of the battle between the death knight Arthas and Anasterian Sunstrider during the attack on Quel'Thalas, from the personal writings of the former priestess Liadrin:\n\n\"All fighting came to a halt. Silence fell over the battlefield. I watched from a distance, helpless as the former prince Arthas cast a spell freezing Anasterian in a coat of ice. The king cast a counterspell, freeing himself as the death knight advanced. Felo'melorn and Frostmourne met, the strident clash of their impact rolling out over the ice and across the blood-drenched tiles.\n\n\"The force of their meeting cleaved Felo'melorn, Flamestrike, in half. Arthas's swing continued, severing the right leg of our aged, beloved king. Even as Anasterian dropped to his remaining knee, he struck out, burying his broken blade in the death knight's thigh. Arthas whirled Frostmourne up, over, and down, thrusting it to the hilt behind Anasterian's collarbone and deep into his chest.\n\n\"The death knight yanked his blade free; Anasterian pitched forward onto the ice.\n\n\"The great king of the high elves was dead. And for many of us that day, our hopes and our hearts died with him.\"\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Five\n\nExcerpt from the journal of Lor'themar Theron, concerning Prince Kael'thas's return in the immediate wake of Quel'Thalas's destruction:\n\n\"Our fallen king, Anasterian, lay upon a table in the tavern hall; his broken blade, Felo'melorn, rested upon his chest, the two pieces joined. I told our prince that the weapon had been shattered in the battle with the death knight Arthas.\n\n\"Kael'thas walked to his father's body and ran his finger over the fracture, remarking that he did not believe it possible for Flamestrike's blade to be sundered. \n\n\"I was left wondering what legacy, if any, awaited our people and the legendary blade that now symbolized not strength or dominance, but fallibility.\"\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Six\n\nIn the time following the devastating Scourge attack on Quel'Thalas, Prince Kael'thas renamed the high elf survivors the sin'dorei, or blood elves. While the prince and a band of blood elves assisted the human troops of Grand Marshal Garithos against the remaining undead forces, it was rumored that Kael'thas kept the pieces of his father's sword, Felo'melorn, on a sideboard in his dilapidated quarters. \n\nKael'thas dreamed of making Flamestrike's blade whole again so that it might serve once more as a symbol of hope, to show his people that even in the face of overwhelming hardship, the blood elves would not be broken.\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Seven\n\nIn time, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider realized his dream of rejoining the broken pieces of Felo'melorn.\n\nIt is said that the sword was reforged with \"magic, and hatred, and a burning need for revenge.\"\n\nThere are some who speculate that the sword was taken to a descendant of Luminarian, the magesmith who originally created the weapon on his legendary arcane forge before the War of the Ancients. This assertion has never been independently verified.\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Eight\n\nAn account of Kael'thas Sunstrider's battle with the death knight Arthas, from the personal writings of Kael'thas:\n\n\"The death knight charged, his blade, Frostmourne, arcing down. I blocked with my staff, but it was no use; the stave shattered. It was then that I revealed my surprise...\n\n\"Felo'melorn. Flamestrike, mended, made whole once again. It burned with righteous fury as our two swords clashed. Each of us held steady, blades pressed tight. I smiled and asked Arthas if he remembered Felo'melorn.\n\n\"He snidely replied that he saw it snap beneath Frostmourne in the instant before he slew my father. When he shoved me back, I told him that I had found the blade, had it reforged...\n\n\"'Broken swords are weak where they are mended, elf,' the despicable former prince said.\n\n\"'Human swords, perhaps,' I replied. And I knew... that day I knew this one thing at least: I might not win, but Felo'melorn would not be broken again. \n\n\"Filled with renewed purpose, I attacked.\"\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Nine\n\nFrom the journal of Lyandra Sunstrider, distant relative of King Anasterian:\n\n\"Today, at last, my efforts to uncover the location of my birthright have borne fruit.\n\n\"It is now made known to me that the sword of my ancestors, Felo'melorn, Flamestrike, resides within the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown Citadel. \n\n\"It was there that the blade was taken to after leaving the possession of the traitor Kael'thas Sunstrider. \n\n\"At last, I shall validate my claim to the Sunstrider throne. I shall seek out Flamestrike, and I shall realize my destiny.\"\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Ten\n\nLast journal entry of Lyandra Sunstrider, distant relative of King Anasterian:\n\n\"Icecrown Citadel, I curse your name.\n\n\"Along empty halls I made my way, through a twisting labyrinth of black saronite, until I beheld a warm, red glow pouring from a room at the end of a dismal passage.\n\n\"I entered and saw... Felo'melorn. Flamestrike, mounted upon a dais. At last, the sword that would solidify my claim to the Sunstrider throne! I approached, awestruck, reached out...\n\n\"And the door slammed shut behind me. The prize I had so long sought was at last within my grasp...\n\n\"But now... I am trapped. Surely death awaits me. Or perhaps... something worse.\"\n\nFelo'melorn, Part Eleven\n\nExcerpt from a speech given by Aethas Sunreaver:\n\n\"My brothers, in the time since the Sunreavers' expulsion from the Kirin Tor, we have endeavored to secure readmission. I tell you now that the key to our salvation exists... it exists within the frozen black halls of Icecrown Citadel, in the possession of a fallen elf--Lyandra Sunstrider.\n\n\"She dwells there now as a reanimated shell of her former self, but I have learned that it is Lyandra who holds the infamous blade of kings, Felo'melorn. Flamestrike. It has been trusted to remain in her keeping by the Lich King himself, to aid in battle against the Legion. Lyandra was obsessed with the blade while she was among the living, and when she ventured to Icecrown to claim it, that obsession proved to be her downfall. However, Lyandra's tragic misstep provides us with an opportunity...\n\n\"An opportunity for the Sunreavers to retake our rightful place... among the Kirin Tor!\"\n\nEbonchill\n\nThe half-elf Alodi wielded Ebonchill during his long tenure as the first Guardian of Tirisfal. He infused the greatstaff with his extraordinary power, and he began a tradition of passing the weapon down from mage to mage. For thousands of years, this practice continued uninterrupted. Some of Azeroth's mightiest spellcasters used Ebonchill to hunt down and vanquish the Burning Legion's wicked agents. \n\nWhen the Legion stole Ebonchill, the tradition put in place by Alodi was broken... but only for a time. Now, in your hands, the greatstaff can once again fulfill its purpose to safeguard Azeroth.\n\nEbonchill, Part One\n\nThe tale of Ebonchill begins with a half-elf mage named Alodi. Though he did not create the staff, he made it into the legendary weapon it is today.\n\nAlodi never knew his real parents. From infancy, he was raised in an orphanage for magically gifted children in Dalaran. His only connection to his parents was Ebonchill, which they had left with the boy when they abandoned him at the school.\n\nHis dubious parentage and mixed ancestry made life difficult for Alodi. Most magi pitied him, but others treated him with scorn. No one believed he would rise to greatness. They were mistaken.\n\nIn time, the orphan would become the first Guardian of Tirisfal, one of the most powerful magi to have ever lived.\n\nEbonchill, Part Two\n\nAlodi became Guardian at a dire time for the Council of Tirisfal. This secret order of magi was created to protect Azeroth from demons. For many years, its members succeeded in their quest.\n\nThen a dreadlord named Kathra'natir changed everything. The demon infiltrated Dalaran and thwarted the council's attempts to stop him. Kathra'natir sowed unrest in the streets, threatening to engulf the city in turmoil.\n\nTo defeat Kathra'natir, the Council of Tirisfal's magi took drastic measures. Through a complex ritual, they infused all of their power into Alodi. It was an act of great trust and faith.\n\nKathra'natir was no match for the newly empowered Alodi. The Guardian unleashed his astonishing power on the demon and banished him from the world in short order.\n\nEbonchill, Part Three\n\nFrom his early days in the Dalaran orphanage, Alodi had been fascinated with frost magic. This was due in part to the icy enchantments woven into Ebonchill. With the staff, Alodi learned how to freeze water and manipulate air temperature, often to the chagrin of the orphanage headmaster.\n\nShortly after Alodi became Guardian, he honed his mastery of frost magic and imbued Ebonchill with his own powers. A wintry aura enveloped the staff. Much to the astonishment of Alodi's companions on the Council of Tirisfal, the weapon never felt cold to the touch. Ebonchill contained only a sliver of Alodi's might, but even that was more than most magi could ever hope of wielding.\n\nEbonchill, Part Four\n\nDuring Alodi's tenure as Guardian, he used Ebonchill to hunt down every demon that stalked the lands of Azeroth. Many records tell of him calling down vicious ice storms to overwhelm his enemies, or encasing the Legion's agents in solid blocks of ice before exiling them from the world.\n\nNear the end of Alodi's one hundred years of service as Guardian, he turned his attention to his apprentices. He had trained and tutored many young magi in the ways of the arcane. They had become the family that he had never had, and he treated them all as his own sons and daughters.\n\nAlodi decided to pass on Ebonchill to one of these learned apprentices. He did not choose the most powerful. More important to Alodi were compassion, wisdom, and comradery. After much consideration, he entrusted his greatstaff to the apprentice who most embodied these traits.\n\nSo began a tradition of bequeathing Ebonchill that would endure for millennia.\n\nEbonchill, Part Five\n\nAll was well with the Council of Tirisfal until the rise of Guardian Aegwynn. The gifted mage grew suspicious of the order. She believed that the council was abusing its power by manipulating the politics of human kingdoms. At the end of her one hundred years of service, she refused to step down as Guardian.\n\nAegwynn's disobedience eventually forced the council's hand. It formed the Tirisgarde, a group of talented magi charged with hunting down and subduing the wayward Guardian. \n\nAmong the Tirisgarde was a promising but arrogant young spellcaster named Tarthen. His aging master had long ago inherited Ebonchill, and he was in the process of choosing which apprentice would take it up next.\n\nTarthen fully expected to receive the greatstaff. He eclipsed his fellow apprentices in raw power and potential. But Tarthen's master put little weight in such things. \n\nWhen the day of the ceremony came, the elderly mage gave Ebonchill to another apprentice--one who embodied the qualities of compassion, wisdom, and comradery.\n\nEbonchill, Part Six\n\nAfter his master passed on Ebonchill to a different apprentice, Tarthen wallowed in anger and bitterness. He believed he had been wronged, and he was determined to prove himself.\n\nTarthen stole Ebonchill from its new owner, taking great care to cover up evidence of his crime. In secret, he practiced with the greatstaff and learned to wield its extraordinary energies. \n\nOnly a handful of Tarthen's most trusted Tirisgarde allies knew of his theft. They alone witnessed him bending Ebonchill's magics to his will, and they were in awe of the power at his fingertips. \n\nOnce he was confident he had mastered Ebonchill, Tarthen set out to do what no other Tirisgarde had thus far managed--he would defeat Aegwynn and forever etch his name in the histories.\n\nEbonchill, Part Seven\n\nAn excerpt from a missive sent to the Council of Tirisfal:\n\n\"We have studied the residual magics at the battle site. Here is our assessment of what transpired.\n\n\"Tarthen confronted Aegwynn in Stranglethorn Vale. In terms of the power used by the two magi, the duel that ensued was one of the greatest to have ever occurred between a Tirisgarde and the renegade Guardian. But it was also one of the shortest.\n\n\"Tarthen bore Ebonchill in battle--the greatstaff reported stolen some months ago. When he unleashed the weapon's stored power on Aegwynn, she immediately turned the energies back on him with a counterspell. A storm of frost magic surged over Tarthen, encasing him in a layer of diamond-hard ice.\n\n\"Despite the hot weather in the region, Tarthen was still frozen solid when we found him. It took considerable effort to thaw his corpse and free Ebonchill from his lifeless hand.\"\n\nEbonchill, Part Eight\n\nThe Council of Tirisfal magi who recovered Ebonchill returned the greatstaff to its owner. Over the following years, the tradition of handing down the weapon from master to apprentice continued. Many of these magi used Ebonchill to protect Azeroth from demons, but not the human named Arrexis.\n\nArrexis was a lover of knowledge. For days on end, he would lock himself in his personal archives, poring over ancient tomes and scrolls. When Ebonchill passed to him, he decided to study the greatstaff rather than wield it in battle. Arrexis knew well the weapon's history and deadly potential.\n\nFrom his examinations, Arrexis believed that he could employ Ebonchill as a catalyst to power great spells--feats of magic that normally only a Guardian would be capable of. Over time, he harnessed the weapon's energies and used them to research new types of warding spells.\n\nEbonchill, Part Nine\n\nArrexis lived in a time of upheaval and turmoil for the Council of Tirisfal. The current Guardian was named Medivh, and he was the son of Aegwynn. Like his rebellious mother, he shunned the council and largely kept to himself. \n\nUnbeknownst to the council and the rest of the world, a great evil stirred in Medivh's soul. Sargeras, leader of the Burning Legion, had possessed the Guardian.\n\nDue to Sargeras's manipulation, Medivh forged a pact with the orcish Horde and began paving the way for its invasion of Azeroth. To prevent the Council of Tirisfal from meddling in his affairs, the darkened Guardian secretly assassinated some of its members.\n\nMedivh's gaze soon fell upon Arrexis and Ebonchill.\n\nEbonchill, Part Ten\n\nIn pursuit of his studies, Arrexis gathered his apprentice magi and established a research camp near Medivh's domain, the tower of Karazhan. The structure was built atop a nexus of potent ley lines. The energies that coursed through Karazhan sometimes warped reality in the region.\n\nArrexis and his followers experimented with their warding magics outside Karazhan, attempting to neutralize the tower's strange powers. The records indicate that Guardian Medivh visited the magi at this time and offered his advice. He suggested that Arrexis could apply his warding spellwork in new ways, specifically to prevent demons from clawing into the world.\n\nThough some members of the Council of Tirisfal distrusted him, Arrexis did not. He welcomed Medivh's support. \n\nArrexis's trusting nature would be his downfall.\n\nEbonchill, Part Eleven\n\nNo one knows for sure what Medivh did during his visit with Arrexis. The details are shrouded in mystery and hearsay. Some rumors claim that the Guardian altered Ebonchill so that it would disrupt Arrexis's warding spells and destroy the venerated mage. \n\nWhatever the truth, it is known that Arrexis heeded Medivh's advice. The elderly mage and his followers conducted a great ritual to protect an area from demonic incursions. The spell was only meant to be a test, but it had disastrous consequences.\n\nWhen the magi began their casting, they inadvertently opened a path between Azeroth and the realm of demons, the Twisting Nether. Arrexis and all of his followers were ripped through the gateway and were never seen again. One account states that within the Twisting Nether, a handful of demons fell upon the shocked magi and slaughtered them to the last.\n\nThe demons were led by an eredar known as Balaadur. He took Ebonchill as a trophy of his bloody victory, and the ancient tradition of passing the greatstaff from master to apprentice died alongside Arrexis and his doomed protege. \n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on!

The scythe is not only a weapon but a symbol. Perhaps its greatest lesson is that the traits of tranquility and furor exist within all living beings, and sometimes the best we can hope for... is to find balance.\n\nMay the Scythe of Elune grant you the strength to destroy your enemies, and the wisdom to know when to stay your hand.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part One\n\nFor millennia, the Scythe of Elune has served as both an embodiment of sacred power and a caution against unbridled rage.\n\nLong ago, in the War of the Satyr, beleaguered night elf forces faced off against an army of demonic foes. Some felt an advantage was needed to turn the tide of battle. To this end, the scythe was created, joining a fang from the wolf Ancient, Goldrinn, with the divinely empowered Staff of Elune.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Two\n\nIt is written that the scythe's creation sprouted from the enmity of a druid, Ralaar Fangfire, and the broken heart of a priestess, Belysra Starbreeze.\n\nRalaar believed he could harness the rage of the pack form to aid the outnumbered night elves against their demonic enemies... but his proposal was denied by the archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, who felt that the form was too unstable.\n\nWhen Ralaar's best friend, Arvell, refused to assume the pack form and died at the hands of demons as a result, Ralaar chose not only to embrace the form, but also to seek out ways of enhancing it. Ralaar found an unlikely ally in Arvell's beloved, the priestess Belysra Starbreeze.\n\nTogether, Ralaar and Belysra joined the fang of Goldrinn with the Staff of Elune to create the legendary Scythe of Elune... a weapon that would alter the course of history.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Three\n\nThe Scythe of Elune has displayed myriad powers over the millennia.\n\nDuring the War of the Satyr, when the headstrong druid Ralaar Fangfire used the Scythe of Elune to enhance the pack form, the result was disastrous. Many druids turned into worgen, feral creatures that viciously attacked both friend and foe.\n\nSo it was that the archdruid Malfurion Stormrage obtained the scythe and used it to banish Ralaar and his fellow worgen to the realm of the Emerald Dream, where he hoped they would remain pacified at the base of the majestic tree Daral'nir.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Four\n\nIt is known that shortly after the War of the Satyr, the Scythe of Elune vanished. Thousands of years later, the scythe would be rediscovered by a night elf priestess, Velinde Starsong.\n\nDesperately seeking a way to overcome yet another incursion of demonic forces, Velinde channeled the scythe's powers to call forth the worgen from their place of banishment in the Emerald Dream.\n\nHowever, Velinde was unable to control the summoned worgen. She sought help from a human mage, but en route to find the sorcerer, she was attacked and killed... and the scythe was lost to history once again.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Five\n\nThroughout its history, the Scythe of Elune has changed hands many times.\n\nOne temporary holder of the scythe was a timid (and extremely lucky) resident of Duskwood named Jitters. Jitters discovered the weapon in an old mine called Roland's Doom.\n\nAn account written in Jitters' own words tells of his retrieving the scythe, at which point he and his comrades were attacked by worgen:\n\n\"They came at us from everywhere, clawing from hidden holes at our feet and dropping upon us from silent perches above.\"\n\nJitters was the only person to escape the worgen onslaught, though he lost the Scythe of Elune during his harried flight from the cursed mine.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Six\n\nAn excerpt from the journal of Archmage Karlain:\n\n\"It was with those cursed beasts, the worgen, at our backs that we rushed into the mine named Roland's Doom.\n\n\"There we beheld an exceedingly gruesome and--to me most of all--heartrending sight. My son, held by clawed worgen hands, knelt beneath the blade of what I would come to know as the Scythe of Elune. The beasts were performing some profane ritual on my boy, an initiation of sorts to enlist him in their Wolf Cult.\n\n\"As I watched, helpless to intervene in time, the Wolf Cult leader's glistening fangs sank viciously into the bare shoulder and chest of my only son.\n\n\"With a gut-wrenching cry rising in my throat, I attacked.\"\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Seven\n\nThe Scythe of Elune has been connected to a mysterious and merciless group of relic hunters known as the Dark Riders.\n\nIt was shortly after the scythe was discovered at the mine Roland's Doom that the riders first made an appearance, butchering a local family in their search for the sacred artifact.\n\nAfter the scythe was claimed by a priest named Revil Kost, the Dark Riders waylaid him and his companions. This attack was in turn interrupted by the commander of the Night Watch, Althea Ebonlocke. What happened next is shrouded in mystery, as the entire assembly disappeared in a blinding flash of light.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Eight\n\nTestimony of Revil Kost, priest of the Church of the Holy Light, to Archbishop Benedictus:\n\n\"It was my firmly held belief that I acted on behalf of the Light.\n\n\"We had recovered the Scythe of Elune from Roland's Doom. I used it as bait to ensnare a band of shadowy, profane thieves known as the Dark Riders.\n\n\"As we fought, the riders teleported us to Karazhan, fabled tower of the one-time Guardian Medivh. It was from there that the riders had originated, seeking artifacts for the tower's menagerie and hidden trophy room.\n\n\"Despite the riders' best efforts and the intervention of the trophy room's curator, their taking of the scythe was not meant to be. With the aid of my companions and my unwavering devotion to the Holy Light, I helped put an end to the Dark Riders' unholy campaign.\"\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Nine\n\nPrior to the great Cataclysm that befell Azeroth, the Scythe of Elune was transported secretly into the walled territory of Gilneas via underground tunnels.\n\nAt this time, the scythe changed hands from an SI:7 gnome assassin, Brink Spannercrank, to night elf supporters of Genn Greymane, king of Gilneas. It was briefly taken by Forsaken agents, but ultimately, the actions of heroic adventurers returned the weapon to the night elves' possession.\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Ten\n\nFrom Priestess Belysra Starbreeze's account of the death of Alpha Prime, leader of the Wolf Cult:\n\n\"It had been Alpha Prime's foremost goal to retake the Scythe of Elune. He still harbored resentment toward the archdruid Malfurion for spurning him when he was simply Ralaar Fangfire, the druid who wanted to take on the pack form during the War of the Satyr. Prime wished to use the scythe to call forth his brethren from the Emerald Dream, to besiege our beloved home of Darnassus.\n\n\"I battled Alpha Prime to the limit of my abilities, but even my greatest efforts proved insufficient. Prime took up the scythe and was prepared to summon his worgen brethren, when he was vanquished by a phantom... the spirit essence of my fallen love, Arvell, who had promised millennia ago that not even death would keep us apart.\n\n\"My love kept his promise, and the Scythe of Elune remained in my keeping.\"\n\nScythe of Elune, Part Eleven\n\nFrom the writings of Belysra Starbreeze:\n\n\"Arvell, there is not a day that goes by when I do not think of you, my love. The sacrifice that you made so long ago, and your reappearance in my hour of greatest need... these are never far from my mind.\n\n\"I vow to you that I will atone for my past indiscretions, for my role in unleashing the worgen curse upon the world. I will find a way to set matters right.\n\n\"As I write this, I prepare to travel with Valorn Stillbough to Duskwood, to further my studies of the worgen. I pray that your spirit will forever guide my heart and my hand. Perhaps at last, with the help of the Scythe of Elune, we will find a way to grant those who are afflicted with the worgen curse the one gift that matters most...\n\n\"Peace.\"\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane\n\nBy reclaiming these weapons, you have struck a heavy blow against the forces of evil. In their hands, these daggers would have been more than a danger; they would have been a sacrilege.\n\nThese are all that remain of a revered Wild God who gave her life in defense of Azeroth. Do you know her story? The druids of Val'sharah, who protected these weapons for so long, could tell you about her. Some of them even remember her.\n\nHer name was Ashamane. She left a powerful legacy, and very soon, it will be yours to wield.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part One\n\nAzeroth was once smothered in darkness. But after the titans broke the Old Gods' Black Empire, natural creatures finally had a chance to grow and flourish. A keeper named Freya was tasked with seeding the world with life. She created lush enclaves all across Azeroth that gave rise to countless animals.\n\nOn occasion, extraordinary creatures captured Freya's attention.\n\nAs Freya traveled, she found a wolf pack that had killed a panther and was trying to finish off her lone surviving cub. Though the wolves had wounded the tiny creature, she still fought fiercely, swiping viciously with her claws at the bigger predators. Freya was astonished to see that, before long, the wolves were driven away, unwilling to suffer further injuries for their meal.\n\nWhen Freya picked up the cub, the keeper endured a flurry of small scratches for her trouble. That did not anger her. Quite the contrary. Delighted by the creature's unrelenting wildness, the keeper healed the cub's injuries and named her Ashamane, for the color of her striking black fur.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Two\n\nOver the years, Ashamane grew into a massive panther. No wolf pack dared to hunt her now. Freya was pleased to see that the panther did not succumb to desires for vengeance. Ashamane could have stalked and killed every wolf in her valley. Easily. But she didn't.\n\nHer wild nature granted her understanding. Was she not a predator as well? Did she not hunt prey? The wolves had had no vendetta against Ashamane; they had been hungry. She bore no malice toward them.\n\nBut she did enjoy toying with them. The wolf pack that had attacked her would sometimes be woken from sleep by an ear-shattering roar. Ashamane would creep up to their den and announce her presence loudly, sending them fleeing.\n\nOver time, Ashamane realized that she had become more powerful than any other panther she had ever seen. The passing years did not age her but instead made her stronger. Generations of wildlife came and went before her eyes.\n\nThere were other animals like her. Powerful, iconic creatures who seemed to live a different existence than the rest of nature. Mortals would soon refer to them as Wild Gods.\n\nAshamane was one of them.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Three\n\nAshamane's untamed heart had difficulty accepting immortality. The chaos of the wilderness, the struggle for survival--they had been the core of Ashamane's being. Now they were irrelevant. She had ascended above her old life. There was no prey that could evade her. There was no joy in an effortless hunt. There was no predator that could challenge her.\n\nAshamane strode openly through the jungles of Azeroth. Other wild creatures had nothing to fear from her. Stories of a giant, majestic panther spread among the trolls who ventured into the area. Some sought to venerate her as one of their loa. Ashamane rarely let them see her. Other trolls tracked her for a different reason. Certain hunters craved the glory that would surely come from bringing down such a magnificent being. Defeating a loa... there was no greater challenge.\n\nOne by one, these ambitious trolls crept into the jungle, arrogance burning in their hearts. Ashamane was delighted. No matter how clever they were, no matter how silently they moved or how true their aim, they all returned to their tribes empty-handed, the sound of her roar still ringing in their ears, and the sight of her fangs forever haunting their dreams.\n\nShe did not need to take their lives. They understood their place in the wilds when she was done with them. That was enough.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Four\n\nWhenever Keeper Freya traveled the land, many Wild Gods walked by her side. Ashamane did not. The panther's heart was too unwilling to be tethered to any other creature. Freya understood, and she always smiled when she saw Ashamane's glowing eyes watching her from afar.\n\nNo matter what Ashamane thought, there would be a connection between them. There was another realm, a wild, untouched place called the Emerald Dream. Keeper Freya had used it to seed life all across Azeroth, and thus, the Wild Gods were bound to it.\n\nEventually Ashamane came to Mount Hyjal to experience the Dream for herself, and she was immediately taken with this thriving vision of an untamed world. The panther made her home on the western slopes of the Well of Eternity and spent thousands of years drifting in the Emerald Dream, exploring its mysteries and power.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Five\n\nAshamane, like many Wild Gods, lived apart from the burgeoning civilizations that rose and fell across Azeroth. The Zandalari trolls held no interest for her. Many elves saw themselves as ascendant, too enlightened to be bothered with the natural world.\n\nBut there came a time when she could no longer ignore Azeroth. The Emerald Dream shook with the arrival of the Burning Legion. Eventually a disciple of another powerful being, Cenarius, called upon the Wild Gods for aid.\n\nFor Ashamane, her duty was clear. She rushed into battle with the Burning Legion without hesitation.\n\nA new predator had come into her world. She was glad to hunt it.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Six\n\nBy the time the Wild Gods joined the War of the Ancients, the fighting had spread far beyond the Well of Eternity.\n\nThe demons who strayed into the forests outside Zin-Azshari soon learned to tread carefully; Ashamane stalked the trees. Her fangs ended the war for many Burning Legion scouts. So greatly was she feared that the Legion took to burning down entire swaths of forest before attempting to advance past her.\n\nIf the demons believed they would have better luck fighting on an open battlefield, they were sorely mistaken. Ashamane was enraged by their tactics, and she joined other Wild Gods, elves, and additional creatures in attacking the Legion's flanks, ripping huge holes in their battle lines.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Seven\n\nThere seemed to be no end to the demons' numbers. When Ashamane fought the Burning Legion ten thousand years ago, her instincts told her that the invaders had specific prey in mind. Tearing herself away from the thick of the battle around Zin-Azshari, she tracked raiding parties that had determinedly cut their way northwest.\n\nIt was not easy to keep up. The demons set their best warriors to discourage pursuit, and Ashamane had to fight every step of the way.\n\nBut she was not deterred. Those who stood in her path fell, one after another.\n\nAs she closed in on her prey, she understood their target: they were aiming to claim Suramar. This is why Ashamane is so honored by the druids of Val'sharah--what she did next has never been forgotten.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Eight\n\nAn army of demons was preparing to lay siege to Suramar. Ashamane faced it alone. She had never visited the forests near Val'sharah before, but that did not matter. They were the wilds, and thus, they were her home.\n\nShe ripped through the demons' ranks and then disappeared into the trees. She crept along the high branches and dove down upon the Legion commanders. She was a terror, a fearsome beast, and she held nothing back, offering no mercy.\n\nIt was a slaughter. And yet even a Wild God could not avoid injury at the Burning Legion's hands. Scorched by fel fire and poisoned by their tainted weapons, Ashamane fought on, thinning their ranks until their leader was forced to face her himself.\n\nThat had been her plan all along. It was one of the laws of survival: the pack was not defeated until its leader's throat was between her jaws.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Nine\n\nA Burning Legion general had volunteered to oversee the conquest of Suramar. This pit lord, Ronokon, saw endless rewards in the elven city and wanted to claim them in Sargeras's name. He became enraged by Ashamane's interference and stepped forth to personally deal with her.\n\nThe Wild God and the annihilan general dueled in the forests of Val'sharah for hours. He was a cunning fighter. He knew how fast she could kill, so he kept her at bay with his jagged, fel-wrought spear, content to inflict small, grazing wounds.\n\nAfter so much war, Ashamane's strength was finally beginning to fade. Her wounds ached. Her pace slowed. But her will was unbroken. With the last of her strength, she leapt at Ronokon, allowing him to drive his spear through her chest. Yet her claws dug into his shoulders, and her fangs sank deep within his neck.\n\nRonokon thrashed madly, trying to pull the panther away, but she held on. Her teeth remained embedded in his throat until he died. His death brought more destruction. The fel power granted to him by the Legion exploded outward, tearing a deep gash in the land and burning Ashamane to ash.\n\nHer sacrifice was not in vain. Suramar's residents had been given enough time to hide their city from the Legion and the world, protecting themselves from the Sundering that would follow.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Ten\n\nThe land around Val'sharah had been altered forever. Where there had once been a hill, now there were a cliff and a deep valley. It took many years for the druids to restore nature in the area to its previous beauty.\n\nDespite the lingering traces of Ronokon's corruption, there was always a sense that something was opposing it, helping to sweep it away. Some druids came to believe that Ashamane's spirit, even after death, was still committed to the fight against the invaders who had threatened her wilds.\n\nThe Fangs of Ashamane, Part Eleven\n\nThe druids built a shrine at the site of the pit lord's death to commemorate Ashamane's courage. Her fangs--all that survived the violence of her passing--were placed there to honor her unbending heart and untamed nature.\n\nTo this day, Ashamane is remembered as one of the fiercest defenders of Azeroth.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc\n\nYou've been blessed by Wild Gods. Please understand the honor that has been granted to you: Ursol believes that you are the right champion to carry on his brother's work.\n\nMay the spirit of Ursoc drive you onward to victory.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part One\n\nUrsoc's legacy is known to every druid on Azeroth. As one of the great Wild Gods, he challenged the Burning Legion ten thousand years ago and bravely laid down his life in defense of this world.\n\nHe was a true guardian. He believed in the power of the wilds, and he never hesitated even for a moment to leap to their defense.\n\nBut now he can rest. Others will need to continue his work.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Two\n\nMany millennia ago, two inquisitive bear cubs roamed the area around the Grizzly Hills together. These brothers, named Ursoc and Ursol, had more curiosity than good sense, and they frequently found themselves trespassing in the domains of bigger predators. Danger did not discourage them, and each one never left the other behind, even when circumstances seemed dire.\n\nThey caught the attention of Keeper Freya, who was traveling across Azeroth in search of exceptional wild animals. Freya recognized their potential and saw what they would become.\n\nWhen they matured, they grew stronger and bigger than any other bears in the Grizzly Hills, and they did not suffer the ravages of aging.\n\nUrsoc and Ursol became known as Wild Gods.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Three\n\nPerhaps the most unusual gift Keeper Freya gave the two bears was the ability to speak. A few other Wild Gods, particularly those who would become known as the August Celestials, also received this gift. While they were chosen for their intelligence, the two bears were chosen for their stubborn bravery.\n\nFreya believed that Ursoc and Ursol would one day change. When they finally saw enough of Azeroth to satisfy their curiosity, they would be compelled to protect it from any enemy that would threaten it.\n\nShe knew them well. Ursoc, the older of the two bears, had a strong protective streak. The more he saw of the wilds of Azeroth, the more he felt it was his responsibility to preserve them.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Four\n\nKeeper Freya saw how the instincts of the Wild Gods matured over the years, and she noticed that some of them were natural guardians of their domain. For those creatures, she began to create unique weapons, items that would aid them in times of trouble... but these artifacts would only become as strong as their wielder made them. Their true potential could only be unlocked with practice, nurture, and self-improvement.\n\nSome Wild Gods did not understand what Freya had given them, and they neglected their weapons. Ursoc was not one of them.\n\nFreya gave Ursoc new claws, fashioned out of a rare material called titansteel and imbued with a small portion of the essence of Eonar, one of the titans. These claws could grow in length and were nearly indestructible.\n\nUrsoc had no intention of letting them waste away and decay. He dedicated himself to mastering their power.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Five\n\nOnce Ursoc received his new claws, he trained tirelessly. Every day he traveled long distances and sparred with his brother, testing his strength. Over the years he grew stronger. Much stronger. Ursol had received a gift, too, a staff that eased the use of magic, and he soon mastered his own power.\n\nUrsoc's titansteel claws became an extension of his body, and Ursol became an expert in manipulating the flows of magical essence.\n\nTogether they had become some of the most powerful Wild Gods in existence... and they would soon become known as Azeroth's staunchest defenders.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Six\n\nEventually Ursoc and Ursol accompanied Keeper Freya on her journeys across Azeroth. She confided in them that she sensed dark forces at work, and they made sure she was safe.\n\nAs they traveled with her, they received their first glimpses of the Emerald Dream, the realm Freya had created to guide Azeroth's natural life. They spent as much time as they could within those untouched wilds, drawn to the Dream's thriving, vibrant vision of nature.\n\nOne day, Freya asked to travel alone. To both Ursoc and Ursol, it sounded as if she was bidding them farewell. Before she left them, she offered more wisdom about their weapons and their other gifts, and she told them to remain prepared. \"Azeroth will need you. If you do not stand ready, the world may fall,\" she said.\n\nThe Wild Gods never saw her again. The darkness that had claimed the mind of Keeper Loken had also corrupted hers.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Seven\n\nTen thousand years ago, a threat unlike any other set its gaze upon Azeroth. The Burning Legion, after corrupting important members of the elven civilization near the Well of Eternity, invaded with all of its might and fury. The first druid, Malfurion, called upon the Wild Gods to fight back against the demonic hordes.\n\nUrsoc and Ursol were the first two Wild Gods to respond. They rushed into battle with the Legion's doomguard, landing the initial blows in the war between Azeroth's wilds and a fallen titan's twisted army.\n\nIt was a desperate fight against overwhelming odds. Neither brother hesitated for an instant, and even when the full wrath of the Burning Legion was brought against them, they did not run.\n\nThey fought until their last breaths.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Eight\n\nMany Wild Gods perished in the war against the Legion. Ursol and Ursoc remained together, fighting back to back, using Freya's gifts to bring down waves of demonic enemies. But their strength had limits. An unending tide of felstalkers finally overwhelmed them, and they both died in battle. Their spirits traveled together to the Emerald Dream, where they stayed for millennia.\n\nUrsoc's claws were all that remained of him in the physical world. When the fighting moved elsewhere, a young furbolg found the titansteel claws. Recognizing whom they had belonged to, he took them to his tribe.\n\nFor generations, those furbolgs worshiped the claws as the final sign of their bear god Ursoc.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Nine\n\nFew furbolgs had the courage to try to wield Ursoc's claws in battle. Every time they did, the results were horrifying. Ursoc had spent untold years mastering their power and unlocking their potential; in the hands of an untrained mortal, they inspired an uncontrollable bloodlust that lashed out at friends as easily as enemies.\n\nAfter a number of attempts, the claws ceased to have any effect at all on the furbolgs. No matter what rituals they tried, it seemed as though the power in the claws had become dormant.\n\nUrsoc's spirit, standing guard in the Emerald Dream, had simply seen enough. The furbolg tribe was not capable of controlling his power, so he withdrew it from the claws. It would not return until someone worthy claimed them.\n\nMembers of the Druids of the Claw eventually brought the titansteel-wrought artifact to Ursoc in the Emerald Dream.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Ten\n\nUrsoc's desire to protect Azeroth had not wavered, even after death. He and Ursol roamed the Emerald Dream, searching for any signs of corruption or darkness taking root in the realm.\n\nRecently, the return of the Emerald Nightmare drew their attention. Ursoc fought Xavius, the lord of the satyrs and a pawn of evil forces, in an attempt to eradicate the Nightmare's influence.\n\nFor a second time, Ursoc made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of Azeroth.\n\nThe Claws of Ursoc, Part Eleven\n\nNow Ursoc can finally rest. Ursol, his brother, continues his watch inside the Emerald Dream, fighting against the Nightmare.\n\nUrsoc's claws no longer belong to the Wild Gods but to those who can carry on their work. Only someone with a guardian spirit as determined as his will be able to wield them in battle.\n\nAnd woe unto any enemy that has to face a creature as dedicated as he.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree\n\nThe Emerald Dream is at risk. The Nightmare seeks to corrupt all of its power.\n\nThis branch was critically important in keeping the Dream stable and peaceful, but it is not safe to leave it there any longer. You are one of the most astonishingly capable druids in history. Carry this staff with you, protect it, and use it to drive the Legion off of our world.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part One\n\nIn Azeroth's ancient days, natural life never had a chance to emerge due to the horrifying reign of the Old Gods. Without help, nature would not have risen at all. The titans knew this. One of their final acts of aid for us was to give the keepers the knowledge and power to reverse the Old Gods' unspeakable destruction.\n\nIn time, nature would rise. Life would flourish. Generations of plants and animals would grow and change.\n\nThis miraculous recovery did not come from any one place. But at the beginning, there was a source of healing and balance, a place where all life could rest and revive.\n\nIt was called G'Hanir, the Mother Tree.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Two\n\nKeeper Freya was charged by the titans to guide the seeding of Azeroth's natural life. To aid in this task, she shaped a mystical realm that would become known as the Emerald Dream. She wanted it to be an unspoiled vision of nature, undisturbed by the forces of evil or external civilizations.\n\nShe began by creating a single, massive tree, set atop a high peak within the Dream. From it bloomed many different fruits and flowers, and new life flowed outward in waves, sweeping across the land.\n\nFreya sculpted pools of life in other locations within the Emerald Dream, but this tree was the first, the tallest, and the most radiant. For millennia, it served as a source of healing and balance that extended beyond the Dream and into the physical world.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Three\n\nAs life flourished on Azeroth, generations of animals came and went. Soon the Emerald Dream was filled with the spirits of countless beasts.\n\nThat first tree that Freya had created, G'Hanir, became a haven for winged creatures. Its many boughs and branches had room for all, and its healing, peaceful energy calmed even the most distressed minds.\n\nMany powerful spirits were drawn to G'Hanir. Some wanted to simply gaze upon it; others wanted to sit at its base and bask in its shade for a while.\n\nOne never left. A Wild God named Aviana made the Mother Tree her home for as long as she lived.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Four\n\nAviana was known as the Mistress of Birds. Unlike some other Wild Gods, she did not keep herself distant from lesser, mortal creatures. She was a predator, delighting in swooping down on prey from the sky.\n\nEventually she was called something new: the Mistress of the Mother Tree. She had grown utterly enchanted with G'Hanir. It was more than a tree; it was a source of life, healing, and peace. Aviana spent years melding her power into the tree, and soon all living winged creatures on Azeroth dreamed of spending the afterlife flying through its branches.\n\nAviana's spirit became intertwined with the Mother Tree. In time, this would have lasting consequences.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Five\n\nTen thousand years ago, Azeroth was invaded. The Burning Legion stormed onto our lands and waged war on all who would resist it. There were few people inclined to fight back, and they were greatly outnumbered.\n\nThe first druid, Malfurion Stormrage, called upon the Wild Gods to join the fight. Not only would a Legion victory eradicate the elves, but it would also spell doom for all life on Azeroth.\n\nMany Wild Gods answered Malfurion's cry. Aviana was one of them.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Six\n\nWhen the Wild Gods joined the battle against the Burning Legion, the demons were taken aback. Surely they had not been expecting nature to produce such powerful enemies. That day will never be forgotten as long as Azeroth remains free of the Legion's control.\n\nAviana led flocks of birds from all the land on the hunt for Legion minions. Untold numbers of demons died to her and her children.\n\nBut the Burning Legion's forces were too great. Aviana fell from the sky, and demonic spears ended her life.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Seven\n\nThe shock of Aviana's death reverberated through the Emerald Dream, and all the leaves of G'Hanir fell from their branches. The great Mother Tree, home to the spirits of countless creatures, was dead. Many mourned for it, and some succumbed to the temptation of serving dark forces in Aviana's absence.\n\nBut although she had died, her spirit still lingered.\n\nAs the night elves struggled to rebuild their society in the wake of the Sundering, members of the green dragonflight discovered a gift. A single branch of G'Hanir, with a single acorn hanging off its leaves, had been left in their keeping in the Emerald Dream.\n\nThe acorn was used by Alexstrasza, Aspect of the red dragonflight, to create Nordrassil, the great World Tree that would protect the second Well of Eternity.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Eight\n\nMalfurion Stormrage sensed that Aviana's spirit had been the one to bestow the branch of G'Hanir, and he believed it was best kept hidden. Many of Aviana's children had been lost to chaos, and they might be driven to claim any remnant of her legacy for their new masters.\n\nQuietly, Malfurion moved the branch of G'Hanir to a safe location deep within the Emerald Dream. Only a few people ever knew where it was kept, but its influence was felt far and wide.\n\nFor many millennia, the branch served as a stabilizing force for the Emerald Dream, and the land near it was said to be a place of great healing and peace.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Nine\n\nThe events of the Cataclysm shook Azeroth and the Emerald Dream to their roots. As the night elves fought to repel the forces of Ragnaros from Mount Hyjal, they asked the champions of Azeroth to summon new allies--or, to be specific, old ones.\n\nMany of the Wild Gods who had died in the War of the Ancients were resurrected. Aviana returned to life on Azeroth and joined the Horde and the Alliance in successfully pushing the elemental forces back into the Firelands. In the end, Ragnaros was killed, and Mount Hyjal was saved.\n\nAviana turned her attention to G'Hanir once again. Times had changed, but her dream of providing a spiritual haven for her kind had not. She set out to restore the Mother Tree to its full glory.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Ten\n\nThe branch of the Mother Tree remained in the Emerald Dream. Unbeknownst to the druids, the forces of the Emerald Nightmare were already gathering for an assault. When they investigated key sources of power within the Dream, they discovered the true nature of G'Hanir.\n\nThe satyr lord Xavius, working on behalf of the Burning Legion to taint the Dream, ordered his forces to exercise caution. This branch of G'Hanir was corrupted slowly, very slowly, in such ways that even its guardians could not sense it.\n\nWhen the Nightmare revealed itself, this branch suddenly pulsed with evil. Had it been left corrupted, it might have thrown the entire Emerald Dream into chaos.\n\nSince it has been cleansed, that plan, at least, was thwarted.\n\nG'Hanir, the Mother Tree, Part Eleven\n\nIt is too dangerous to leave G'Hanir hidden anymore. The Nightmare covets the branch's power; obscurity will no longer suffice. The strength of the Mother Tree must be used to drive the forces of evil away from Azeroth. Aviana agrees, and sends it off with her blessing.\n\nPerhaps one day this branch will be returned to the Dream to once again bring peace and stability to the realm.\n\nBut for now, its true value will be in the hands of a champion. Its destiny is to save countless lives and cleanse corruption from our world.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on! There's more information to be uncovered in these texts. The only thing that can hold me back is time!\n\nCome back after further research has been completed and I will continue to expand this tome.\n\n- Lead Historian Celadine\n", "authors": ["Lead Historian Celadine "]}, {"id": "14836", "title": "Tome of Blighted Implements", "text": "Tome of Blighted Implements\n\nAs recorded by Mile Raitheborne, Head Researcher of the Council of Six.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester\n\nThose who care for their souls would be wise not to trifle with this cursed scythe. Few among the living know its origins, but its powers are well known to the dead.\n\nUlthalesh gorges on the souls of its victims, gaining strength with each massacre. During the War of the Ancients, Sargeras gifted one of his favored necrolytes with this infernal blade. At the time, it was known only as Ulthalesh; it wouldn't earn its grim epithet until later, after Deadwind Pass was turned into a charnel house, its inhabitants obliterated, the land itself bereft of all life.\n\nSince then, Ulthalesh has grown even more powerful.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part One\n\nBefore his fall from the titan Pantheon, Sargeras defended creation from demons, imprisoning untold numbers of them in Mardum, the Plane of Banishment. Over the millennia, these demons were not idle. The dreadlord Ulthalesh ruled the pocket dimension with an iron fist, plotting for the day when he would exact vengeance.\n\nWhen Sargeras shattered Mardum to recruit forces for the Burning Legion, he offered his former prisoners an ultimatum: join him or be cast into oblivion. Most of the demons accepted, but scores refused, rallying around Ulthalesh. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a great felsteel scythe from the fires of Mardum's destruction, and he used it to harvest the souls of the recalcitrant demons, confining them in a new prison. Ulthalesh, strongest of will, was the last to be devoured.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Two\n\nSargeras named the scythe Ulthalesh, after the dreadlord who had risen up against him. Ulthalesh's spirit gave the weapon unfathomable strength, but with that strength came a curse, for those who bore Ulthalesh were inevitably consumed by it. The scythe would obey its masters' commands until they were mortally wounded; then Ulthalesh would feast on their souls. Over the centuries, Sargeras bestowed the blade upon cunning nathrezim, ferocious doomlords, and even potent demigods, only to see their spirits devoured by Ulthalesh after they fell. The scythe grew stronger with each master it absorbed, and it became difficult for Sargeras to find servants who could control the weapon.\n\nOver the wailing of souls trapped within the scythe, the Dark Titan could hear Ulthalesh's grim laughter.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Three\n\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the peoples of Azeroth rebelled against the Burning Legion's invasion, and Sargeras sought to break their will with Ulthalesh. But first, he had to find a servant who was powerful enough to wield it.\n\nHis thoughts turned to the eredar Sataiel. She was the first necrolyte with the strength to command the spirits of the living and the dead with fel magic, a feat that rivaled even Kil'jaeden's necromantic abilities. She was also notoriously ambitious, and fearless to the point of arrogance. Ulthalesh's baleful reputation did not sway her. When Sargeras gifted her with the weapon, she accepted it eagerly.\n\n\"I shall be its final master,\" Sataiel said.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Four\n\nMillennia ago, Sargeras gave Ulthalesh to Sataiel and commanded her to reap the souls of Azeroth's rebellious denizens, starting with the area that would later be known as Deadwind Pass. No one knows what the land was called before the coming of Sataiel. Most would rather not think of it at all. It is the burial site of countless trolls who were methodically slain, their spirits consumed by Ulthalesh, fueling its power to murder more. The scythe would feed and feed until all of the inhabitants were dead.\n\nBut Sataiel knew this was just the beginning, a promising start that only hinted at what Ulthalesh was capable of. Sargeras had dispatched her to break the will of Azeroth's denizens. It was not enough simply to kill them; bodies could be buried and forgotten. She decided to strike at the very heart of the land so that no new life could take up residence. With Ulthalesh, she would see that Deadwind Pass stood as a monument to the Legion's wrath.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Five\n\nUlthalesh has had many masters, but Sataiel was the first to discover the scythe's true potential.\n\nAfter she used Ulthalesh to consume the souls of all living creatures in Deadwind Pass, she turned the blade on the land itself, draining it of life. The trees were reduced to withered husks. The marshes became a desiccated waste. The sky turned a sepulchral gray, the sun covered in a burial shroud. Sataiel relished the despair of the scythe's new prisoners as they unwittingly assisted in the annihilation of their home. The destruction was absolute. Even Azeroth's slumbering world-soul quailed.\n\nSataiel was impressed with her handiwork. So was Ulthalesh.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Six\n\nFrom the journal of Sataiel, recovered from the ruins of Deadwind Pass:\n\n\"I surveyed the ruination I had wrought with great Ulthalesh, and it was glorious. The land was a mausoleum. Everywhere was blight, decay, destruction-except for one area. The explosive force from our ritual had carved a massive crater into the ground, and it roiled with unnatural energies, forming a magical nexus. I knew in my bones that I had birthed a fount of power more potent than the scythe itself.\n\n\"I must inform Sargeras. But something gives me pause, something I cannot dismiss.\n\n\"What claim does Sargeras have to this power? Who else but I could have wielded the scythe to the fullness of its potential? No one. Ulthalesh knows this. He urges me not to surrender our progeny.\n\n\"With such strength at our command, he says we may one day challenge Sargeras.\"\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Seven\n\nLike all who presume to wield this pernicious blade, Sataiel was ambitious, strong willed, and supremely confident. She had come to Azeroth to prove herself to Sargeras, but when she saw the heights of power she could reach with Ulthalesh, she wondered whether she'd set her sights too low. She had massacred thousands, turned the land into a tomb, and ripped open a magical nexus of unspeakable force. Her destiny was bright, and she needed no one's patronage to achieve it.\n\nUlthalesh whispered to Sataiel from the scythe, infecting her mind. She decided to keep the magical nexus for herself, and she cast potent wards to hide it from the outside world. Then she cut off all contact with the Legion, biding her time until she and Ulthalesh had the strength to challenge the Dark Titan.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Eight\n\nFor centuries, the necrolyte Sataiel guarded Ulthalesh and hoarded the magical nexus they had created. When Sargeras discovered her deception, he was furious. The fount of power was his by right, and Sataiel was keeping it from him. Not only that, but his spies informed him that she was harboring delusions of grandeur, conspiring with the spirit of Ulthalesh to slay Sargeras. Such arrogance could not go unpunished. The upstart eredar had to be eliminated.\n\nSargeras found his champion in Scavell, the Guardian of Tirisfal. He sent the Guardian visions of a dangerous entity lurking in Deadwind Pass, a demon awaiting the return of the Burning Legion. Scavell boldly took up the charge, hunting down Sataiel and, after an epic battle, slaying her with her own weapon. Her soul was cast screaming into the scythe.\n\nAs the Guardian examined the blade, he was filled with dread. Rarely had he seen so mighty an instrument of death, and though he had slain its bearer, he wondered whether the real threat remained unchecked. He decided to hide Ulthalesh where no one would find it.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Nine\n\nEmpowered by Sataiel's spirit, the scythe had grown immeasurably stronger. There seemed to be no limit to how powerful it could become. Sargeras knew of Ulthalesh's scheming, of his promises to Sataiel that they could one day rival the Dark Titan. Although he dismissed this as mere bravado, he refused to give Ulthalesh the opportunity to make good on his threat.\n\nCenturies after Scavell hid Ulthalesh, Sargeras twisted the Guardian Medivh's mind so he would assist him in regaining control of the scythe. The Guardian became obsessed with this task, and he dispatched the cursed Dark Riders to search for the blade and bring it back to the tower of Karazhan, which had been built on top of the magical nexus in Deadwind Pass--the nexus that Sataiel and Ulthalesh had created. Sargeras was pleased. It was only a matter of time before the Dark Riders would find the weapon, making a mockery of Ulthalesh's ambitions.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Ten\n\nSo powerful was Medivh's charge that the Dark Riders continued their quest for Ulthalesh even after the Guardian's death. Eventually, their leader, Ariden, was drawn to the scythe when he sensed the keening of the trapped souls within, and he brought it to the catacombs beneath Karazhan.\n\nAriden lacked the willpower and ingenuity of Sataiel, and his stewardship of Ulthalesh did not last long. There are conflicting reports about how he met his end. Some say he succumbed to the scythe's curse after he was defeated in battle, but others tell a different story. By all accounts, however, Ulthalesh went missing soon after Ariden's death. Its current whereabouts are unknown. Legend holds that only an individual of exceptional skill and fortitude can control it now.\n\nUlthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester,Part Eleven\n\nThe following is an excerpt from A Hypothetical Examination of the Legion's Weaknesses, author unknown. It has been deemed apocryphal by the Archival Authority of Argus and is currently banned in all Legion-controlled worlds.\n\n\"There are few things in creation that Sargeras fears. The Deadwind Harvester, Ulthalesh, is one of them. The necrolyte Sataiel regrets that she did not attempt to slay the fallen titan with it when she had the chance, so she will test whoever dares to wield the weapon in her stead. Ulthalesh does not mind. The scythe's master will either overcome Sataiel or be consumed, which will only make the blade more powerful. And then another bearer will take their place. And another.\n\n\"Ulthalesh has been playing this game with Sargeras for millennia. He knows the meaning of patience.\"\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari\n\nBehold the skull of Thal'kiel the Denied, once a great leader of the eredar. He gazed into the depths of the Great Dark Beyond and embraced that which gazed back. He saw worlds consumed by fel fire, dark creatures of the Twisting Nether overrunning mortal civilizations, the conquest of creation. Now all that remains of him is this skull, which lends the bearer his power to command demons.\n\nLike most skulls, Thal'kiel's comes with a cautionary tale. Never mind that it's been heeded by none.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part One\n\nBefore the coming of Sargeras to Argus, the eredar Thal'kiel ushered in a golden age for his people. Thal'kiel was a sorcerer of unparalleled talent, and he and his Wakeners pushed the limits of summoning and binding magics, conjuring the arcane entities that helped build the capital's wondrous architecture. Thal'kiel also devised the machines that focused the world's latent arcane energy, suffusing Argus with peace, harmony, and vitality. All were in awe of his abilities, including his young apprentice, Archimonde.\n\nThere were rumors that Archimonde coveted Thal'kiel's power and influence, but the eredar leader dismissed these as pure fabrication, for his apprentice had shown him nothing but devotion. Archimonde had even gone to great lengths to commission a custom-made crown for Thal'kiel, taking the measurements for his head himself.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Two\n\nThal'kiel led an order of eredar magi called the Wakeners, specialists in the arts of conjuration and binding. They were renowned for their clever arcane constructs, exploring new frontiers in summoning. Yet Thal'kiel was never one to rest on his laurels. He thirsted for more. Seeking to elevate his order to levels undreamed of, he searched uncharted terrain, venturing farther than any eredar had dared before. His spells plumbed the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond, petitioning for a deeper well of power.\n\nOne day, he received an answer.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Three\n\nThal'kiel was brilliant, but he was not wise. A dark presence whispered to him, and the eredar's mind was consumed with visions of power beyond his wildest imaginings, of ranks upon ranks of deadly servants eager to obey his every whim. These demonic forces made Thal'kiel's arcane constructs look like a child's playthings. Afterward, he would despise the arcane, his passion reserved only for fel magic.\n\nThal'kiel's mysterious benefactor bestowed upon him the ability to summon lesser demons, and the eredar immediately spread the knowledge to his Wakeners. Imps and felhounds, infernals and abyssals, all executed the commands of Thal'kiel and his sorcerers. Convinced that this was the start of a new era, Thal'kiel feverishly prepared to present his wondrous pets to the rulers of Argus, Velen and Kil'jaeden.\n\nBrilliant. Not wise.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Four\n\nIn the presence of Velen, Kil'jaeden, and the eredar rulers' inner circle, the sorcerer Thal'kiel demonstrated what his fel darlings could do. First, he summoned scores of his familiar arcane constructs and arrayed them in orderly rows. Then the sky went dark, and the clouds roiled as a storm of meteors crashed down. From the craters emerged an army of infernals--which Thal'kiel unleashed on the constructs. It was a symbolic display of the new era he saw for his people. He watched rapturously as the demons obliterated the unfortunate arcane entities, smashing and burning them until only smoke and embers remained. Such was the demons' fury that even the nearby columns and statues were reduced to rubble and ash. An acceptable sacrifice on the altar of progress, as far as Thal'kiel was concerned.\n\nBut when he looked upon his colleagues' faces, he didn't see the approval he expected. Kil'jaeden's expression was remote, inscrutable, but there could be no doubt about how Velen felt. He condemned Thal'kiel's new summonings and ordered him never to conjure them again.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Five\n\nThe following is from an account of Thal'kiel's last days, written by an anonymous Wakener. It was recovered from Archimonde's private archive.\n\n\"After Master Thal'kiel's disastrous demonstration, Velen forbade him from conjuring demons, denouncing his 'new era' as a failed experiment. Thal'kiel withdrew to his chambers for weeks. He neither ate nor slept. His only companions were the demonic minions he would summon and then banish in rage, or so we guessed--all we could hear were the shrieks of imps as they were thrust back and forth between this realm and the Twisting Nether. We also sensed the presence of other, larger entities with him, shadowy apparitions of baleful influence, though his servants swore that no one had entered his sanctum.\n\n\"When finally Thal'kiel emerged, he was changed. He had aged by centuries, alone in the dark with his thoughts and his thralls. His back was twisted and stooped, and there was an odd glimmer in his eye. He summoned his Wakeners, and we answered the call, for we loved him like a father.\n\n\"He looked at each of us in turn, and said only, 'The new era begins.'\"\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Six\n\nThal'kiel commanded his Wakeners to continue their experiments in summoning fel creatures. In secret, he and his sorcerers conjured demons of increasingly dire aspect, and they cast powerful spells to hide their minions in covert training grounds. Shielded from the eyes of Velen and Kil'jaeden, Thal'kiel slowly amassed a great demonic army with one purpose: to install him as dictator of Argus.\n\nThe Wakeners were united behind Thal'kiel, save one--his apprentice, Archimonde. Although he had no aversion to demons-in fact, he rather enjoyed them--Archimonde was driven by ambition, and he was eager to prove himself to Velen and Kil'jaeden. The night before the Wakeners were to stage their coup, Archimonde revealed Thal'kiel's plans to the rulers of the eredar.\n\n\"You shall have his head for this,\" Archimonde said.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Seven\n\nVelen and Kil'jaeden were stunned to learn of Thal'kiel's treachery. He had summoned legions of fel beasts to build his personal empire, plotting to assassinate the eredar rulers. He had tapped into a strange new source of power whose limits were unknown, and he needed to be stopped, swiftly and without mercy. To prove his loyalty to Velen and Kil'jaeden, Archimonde broke the wards that hid where Thal'kiel's demonic army was marshaled, and he led a contingent of magi in storming the secret training grounds.\n\nThe battle did not last long. Caught off guard, the Wakeners were easily defeated by the invading magi, and without commanders to direct them, the demons were slaughtered. Archimonde himself confronted his master as he was summoning reinforcements. With a single stroke of his blade, he decapitated Thal'kiel.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Eight\n\nFrom chapter one of A Treatise on Eredar Phrenology:\n\n\"The science of phrenology--the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude--became popular in Argus around the time of the Second Duumvirate. Its proponents believed that an eredar's mental faculties, such as willpower, memory, and perception, could be attributed to the shape and size of various protuberances on that individual's skull. Some theorized that if an eredar's skull was sufficiently well-proportioned for spellcasting, it could be utilized to channel magical energies even after death. This practice was deemed too barbaric to be put into common use, though it was not unheard of.\n\n\"Among the most prominent phrenologists during this period were Thal'kiel and Archimonde. Thal'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer's skull, for which he was widely admired.\"\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Nine\n\nAfter they crushed Thal'kiel's rebellion, the eredar rulers' magi burned the Wakeners' bodies so their fel taint would not spread, and they destroyed the rebels' writings to suppress the knowledge of their foul arts. Archimonde oversaw the effort, and when it was done, he was hailed as a hero.\n\nSoon afterward, Archimonde commissioned one of Argus's finest jewelers to gild Thal'kiel's skull. He claimed that he was preparing it for viewing--as a grim warning not to follow Thal'kiel's path. In truth, he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its ability to channel magical energy, the perfect decoration for the perfect sorcerer's skull, which Archimonde proudly displayed in his domicile.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Ten\n\nArchimonde eventually rose to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil'jaeden, and by all accounts, he was a wise and sagacious ruler. In actuality, however, a demonic presence had been slowly infiltrating Archimonde's mind, using Thal'kiel's skull as a conduit for its pernicious influence. While Archimonde slept, he saw visions of civilizations consumed in magnificent fel fire, and a dark god standing at the head of a glorious army. The entity whispered promises of strength that were impossible for mere mortals to comprehend, and Archimonde drank them in, eager to learn more of this mysterious being and his invincible legions.\n\nThus when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, finally came to Argus and offered the eredar a place in his kingdom, Archimonde was the first to accept.\n\nThe Skull of the Man'ari, Part Eleven\n\nAfter Archimonde became one of the Burning Legion's generals, he put Thal'kiel's skull to good use. In life, Thal'kiel had been unmatched in his ability to control demonic minions, and his skull was no less adept. World after world fell before Archimonde as he channeled his commands through the skull, compelling multitudes of demons to obey, his forces obliterating opponents with the grace and precision of an expertly choreographed ballet.\n\nSince then, possession of Thal'kiel's skull has passed between a handful of Sargeras's elite generals, with preference given to those who lead invasions of the fallen titan's most sought-after worlds. The dreadlord Mephistroth, commander of the Legion's vanguard in Azeroth, was the last to be seen with it.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras\n\nMortal hands were not meant to hold this staff. It was forged on the orders of Sargeras after his defeat in the War of the Ancients, intended as a means to conquer Azeroth once and for all. This scepter rips open the fabric of reality, obliterating the barriers between worlds, destroying everything that stands between you and your goal.\n\nIf you're lucky, that's all the damage it will do.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part One\n\nDuring the War of the Ancients, the night elf queen Azshara and her Highborne sorcerers attempted to open a portal that would allow Sargeras into Azeroth. The challenge was unprecedented; never before had anyone built a gateway that was strong enough for a titan. For weeks the Highborne labored without rest, crafting and weaving spells to devise a passage through the night elves' colossal fount of power, the Well of Eternity.\n\nBut just as Sargeras was about to emerge into the world, the night elf resistance disrupted the Highborne's spellwork and demolished the Well of Eternity. Sargeras was cast back into the Twisting Nether, his ambition denied, his greatest chance to conquer Azeroth slipping from his grasp. The Dark Titan swore revenge.\n\nHe would tear down the walls between himself and his prize.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Two\n\nAfter his defeat at the Well of Eternity, Sargeras immediately planned his next method of infiltrating Azeroth. He knew he couldn't rely on a static portal; to serve a titan, such a gateway required an astronomical amount of power, and the most promising source had been destroyed in his last attempt. Moreover, the Highborne's laborious preparation and spellwork had given away his intentions, which had allowed the night elf resistance to thwart him. If he wanted to overcome Azeroth's defenders, Sargeras needed to enter the world with minimal warning.\n\nThus he commanded the eredar to forge a tool that would wrench open rifts between worlds for only a short time, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn't enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion's invasion or carry out subtler schemes.\n\nSuch an instrument would also weaken the integrity of the physical universe and threaten to collapse it, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Three\n\nMillennia ago, Sargeras ordered his most talented eredar sorcerers to construct him a cosmic battering ram. They did not disappoint.\n\nFirst, scores of magi conducted dark rituals to channel countless portals into a single staff. They then projected the empowered artifact into every corner of the Great Dark Beyond, weaving it into the fabric of reality, creating a thread that could be pulled to unravel the seams of the physical universe at will. To fuel this monstrous undertaking, a hundred warlocks sacrificed a hundred demons, selecting them from among the Legion troops that had been part of the failed invasion of Azeroth.\n\nThus was forged the Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras. Thus was born Azeroth's doom.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Four\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras is known for the gleaming jewel that adorns its apex. Many theorize that it represents Sargeras's baleful eye, which caught only a glimpse of Azeroth before the fallen titan was ripped back to the Twisting Nether. But the truth is far different.\n\nSoon after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: the Well of Eternity imploded once again, but this time, it dragged him down to the very core of Azeroth. He was there for only an instant, but in that moment, he saw Azeroth's slumbering world-soul--and in that moment, the world-soul opened one eye and gazed at the Dark Titan. He was enraptured.\n\nSince then, the eye of Azeroth's world-soul has not been far from his thoughts. He commanded the eredar who forged the scepter to crown it with that lone, wondrous orb. Next to it, the eredar placed two nathrezim wings, a testament to Sargeras's conception of the world-soul: corrupted, demonic, and most importantly, his.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Five\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras was a marvel of arcane and fel sorcery, an instrument fit for a titan. It could lacerate the connective tissue of the physical universe, opening portals to any realm Sargeras desired, yet the rifts it created would allow only a portion of his soul to enter. It was a minor setback. Sargeras would simply have to be more inventive with his plans. And so, he waited.\n\nMillennia later, Sargeras saw his opportunity. The Guardian Aegwynn had become the most powerful mage on Azeroth, and not even the Council of Tirisfal could control her. Her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption. Sargeras could not infiltrate Azeroth in his most lethal form, but perhaps he could use the rebellious Guardian as a vessel for his machinations.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Six\n\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\n\n\"We had finished routing the Legion's minions when the sky turned black. My mouth went dry, and the hairs on my neck bristled, responding to stimuli that my mortal senses could not comprehend. It was like the coming of a monstrous storm, right before the thunderheads would unleash their cataclysmic onslaught. Yet the air remained as still as great Galakrond's bones. Something was wrong, very wrong, and all we could do was wait.\n\n\"I'll always remember the sound. That slippery, hollow, CRACKING sound, like that of a mace splitting a giant's skull. But it was bigger than that-louder, longer. It pierced me like an arrow through my chest, though I knew the breach had happened some distance away. The edges of the world seemed to quiver, and for an instant I thought they might collapse. But they did not.\n\n\"That was when the avatar of Sargeras entered the field of battle.\"\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Seven\n\nIn the icy wastes of Northrend, Sargeras drew the Guardian Aegwynn into battle, advancing on his opponent as the portal he'd torn into Azeroth closed behind him. His avatar was but a pale shadow of his true form, but that hardly mattered. After all, even if he couldn't defeat Aegwynn, he could still use her for his own ends. He had only to weaken her defenses, to create an opening for a shard of his spirit to break through. Just as he'd infiltrated Azeroth with the scepter, so too would he invade Aegwynn's soul, corrupting it into another instrument of the Legion.\n\nAfterward, Aegwynn would remember the battle as the most brutal she'd ever fought, but she finally destroyed the avatar of Sargeras in an avalanche of arcane might. As she stood triumphant over her fallen foe, she could scarcely believe that she had won.\n\nLittle did she know that she had lost.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eight\n\nFrom the journal of Aegwynn, Guardian of Tirisfal:\n\n\"I have defeated the avatar of the Great Enemy, Sargeras, but I cannot enjoy my victory. There is a hollowness inside my breast, a persistent ache from a wound whose origin I do not know. It must be from the strain of the battle.\n\n\"I will dispose of the remnants of the fallen titan's incursion. His avatar, though but a fragment of his full form, rivals Galakrond in stature, and I cannot let his bones take up residence next to the gargantuan proto-dragon's. Who knows what foul taint lies in wait to be released? Even in death, the corpse is malevolent, gripping its cursed scepter as if it still intends to rule.\n\n\"The scepter. No one must be allowed to wield it. This was the instrument Sargeras used to enter Azeroth, tearing a gash in the universe that threatened to obliterate our world. The eye on top of the staff stares out, mocking me. I shall ensure that it never sees the light of day again.\"\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Nine\n\nAfter Aegwynn defeated Sargeras's avatar, she interred his corpse in the ruins of Suramar, along with the artifacts that he bore. Deep beneath the sea, shielded by enchanted Highborne seals, the Scepter of Sargeras remained for centuries, its power undiminished.\n\nSargeras attempted to regain control of the staff through Aegwynn, but the task proved more difficult than he had estimated. He could sway the Guardian in many ways, but he could not compel her to exhume his scepter from its watery grave. Something held her back, a primal instinct louder than Sargeras's whispering. She knew the artifact was dangerous, that its use risked the destruction of all things. Even possessed by the Dark Titan, she would not yield.\n\nSargeras realized that greater subtlety was needed. Eventually, he extended his pernicious influence to Aegwynn's son, Medivh, as he developed in her womb. Through this new vessel, Sargeras planned to recover his beloved scepter.\n\nHad he succeeded, the world of Draenor might not have been annihilated.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Ten\n\nOther than the Dark Titan, the Scepter of Sargeras has had few wielders. One of them was the orc warlock Ner'zhul.\n\nAfter the Horde's defeat in the Second War, Ner'zhul sought to reinvigorate his followers by opening gateways to new worlds for them to conquer. To that end, he dispatched his servants to recover various artifacts from the Tomb of Sargeras, including the scepter, which the fallen titan had used to infiltrate Azeroth centuries before.\n\nNer'zhul was not Sargeras, however, so he could not simply command the staff to open portals. He had to wait until the constellations of Draenor were properly aligned, and he could only use the scepter in conjunction with other artifacts. The warlock grew impatient, frustrated with his limitations. Intoxicated by the Skull of Gul'dan's influence, he had visions of his erstwhile apprentice, who urged him to unleash his godlike powers.\n\nWhen at last the moment arrived for Ner'zhul to act, he did so with wild abandon, heedless of the consequences. It mattered not to him if Draenor was destroyed; in fact, he welcomed it as part of his legacy. With the scepter, he blasted hole after hole through the fabric of reality, shredding the seams connecting Draenor to the rest of the physical universe. As he rushed headlong through one of the portals, he could hear the world shattering behind him.\n\nThe Scepter of Sargeras, Part Eleven\n\nAfter Draenor was destroyed, the demon lord Kil'jaeden wrested control of the Scepter of Sargeras from Ner'zhul. At last, the artifact was back in the Legion's possession, and Kil'jaeden would set about using it to invade Azeroth.\n\nBut he was not as powerful as Sargeras; he could not open a portal mighty enough even for his avatar. Thus he conspired with Kael'thas Sunstrider to create a gateway through the Sunwell, the blood elves' ruined fount of power. Combined with the world-rending force of the scepter, Kael'thas's portal cleared the way for Kil'jaeden's full form.\n\nHowever, before the demon lord could set foot on Azeroth, Anveena, the embodiment of the Sunwell's energies, intervened. She sacrificed herself, unleashing all of her strength on the Deceiver and allowing him to be thrown back into the Twisting Nether-along with the Scepter of Sargeras.\n\nThe staff has not been seen on Azeroth since. A small comfort, for surely the Legion will use it to infiltrate the world once again. But no matter who wields it, the threat it poses is unspeakable. The destruction of Draenor is testament to the devastation that even mortals can wreak with this weapon.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on.

He touched the side of his face, gasping. \"What if we are characters in a book!?\"\n\nOld Ri hugged his belly with both hands and bellowed a deep, contemplative laugh.

The farmer's market?\" In the cool autumn darkness, the Halfhill Market was like an island of warm yellow light amongst the dark undulating hills. Colorful flags rippled in the chill breeze, and figures could be seen moving amongst the stalls, buying supplies or bartering the fruits of their labor. The sound of their voices and laughter, indistinguishable from one another but unmistakably alive, could be heard all the way to the inn.\n\n\"Those figures moving about, each of them has a soul,\" Old Ri continued. \"And together, we share this space. Millions of souls, sharing one place together. Our place!

He breathed in the cool air, and watched fireflies dart amongst the waving starlit grasses of the fields below. \"Ri,\" he said at last. \"Painting or no... if our souls are to share a place, I would share no other with you.\"\n\nOld Ri tipped his hat back over his eyes and answered with a warm rumble of agreement.\n\nThe sound of crickets mixed with the lively bustle of the market below lulled the two friends back into a blissful silence.", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "14840", "title": "A Zombie's Guide to Proper Nutrition", "text": "Brrrraaaaaiiins.

There was an ancient scroll written in a strange language that talked about the Pools of Youth. It would appear to pre-date Azshara's rule.\n\nThe odd part is the language is neither elves nor trolls. This fascinating bit of news would imply that there were societies older than that of our own on Azeroth.\n\nFrom what I could decipher, the Pools of Youth were actually the property of an ancient dynasty. What race comprised this dynasty still remains a mystery.\n\nThere is something sinister about the writings of this \"Dojani dynasty\" however. There are also references to an imperial seat and a valley of golden blossoms. \n\nThe choice bit of news is that they included coordinates to their kingdom's \"heart of power.\" I should be able to have one of our new arcane mages provide us a portal if I can convince Tyrande to approve the mission.\n\nEntry 2\n\nTyrande is a stubborn unruly woman!

Deems the mission \"too risky.\" \n\nHow is the mortality of our people to be dismissed as \"too risky\"? Oh she insists that we made the right choice setting aside our immortality when we had to save Azeroth. But I believe that is a fixable issue. \n\nThere is more than one way to live forever!\n\nEntry 3\n\nTyrande is a goddess! She approved my mission! Granted, she insisted I take my daughter and nearly a battalion of sentinels with me but no matter. I can proceed.\n\nIt would seem her ladyship was beset by dreams and visions of the same golden valley I told her of in my research. \n\nFor her, the visions gave her a sense of healing and a need for peace. But her visions also had something about danger and \"gets worse before it gets better\" type of warnings. \n\nThe scrolls my research came from spoke of a peaceful land as well so I am not sure what she is so concerned about.\n\nEntry 4\n\nI think my daughter is annoyed she has been assigned to keep me safe.

As tools of assassination, they are unparalleled. And every moment of every day that you carry them, they will seek to bend your mind to the will of their master, Kil'jaeden. \n\nPerhaps one day you will be able to thank him personally for that.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part One\n\nThese daggers were forged to spill the blood of heroes and innocents. In the hands of Garona Halforcen, they did just that.\n\nAnguish and Sorrow were named well. In their history, they have killed kings, commanders, soldiers, magi, demons, and countless others. If things had gone a little differently, it might have been these weapons that allowed the first Horde to conquer Azeroth. \n\nThe story of these daggers begins on Draenor, soon after the Burning Legion had sunk its claws into the orc clans.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Two\n\nIn the early days of the Horde, Gul'dan had taken Garona under his care. As a half-orc, half-draenei outcast, Garona had found survival to be brutally difficult since she was born. She had learned quickly how to avoid unwinnable fights, and how to quietly kill relentless pursuers. \n\nGul'dan bound her mind to his will and began to secretly train her in the art of assassination. She did not fully understand his intentions, but she grew to resent his cruelty. Still, she obeyed. Survival demanded nothing less.\n\nGarona proved to be skilled with almost any weapon she held, but Gul'dan was not satisfied. His grip on the Horde was still tenuous; assassinating his enemies could backfire if the involvement of his Shadow Council became known.\n\nHe needed weapons that would allow Garona to kill for him with impunity.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Three\n\nThe Horde's first warchief held the solution to Gul'dan's problem. Warchief Blackhand and his clan, the Blackrocks, had the most advanced weapon foundries among all the orcs of Draenor. Gul'dan approached them quietly, asking how their ancestors had created the powerful, legendary weapon of Doomhammer.\n\n\"It was a gift from the fiery heart of Draenor,\" they told him.\n\nThat was no help. Gul'dan wanted to break the orcs' reverence of the elements; asking the Furies of Draenor for more weapons might strengthen it instead. Gul'dan turned to Kil'jaeden for assistance, imploring the Burning Legion for aid.\n\nKil'jaeden saw the value of having a covert assassin at the Shadow Council's command. He gave Gul'dan strict instructions... and the raw materials needed to create two of the deadliest weapons Draenor would ever know.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Four\n\nWarchief Blackhand was intrigued by Gul'dan's request. The warlock had asked for two daggers created from a mysterious type of ore that no orc had ever seen before, and he wanted them imbued with a power that would only reveal itself when the time was right. Blackhand agreed to make the weapons himself in his foundry.\n\nAs Blackhand quenched the blades, he felt a terrible, dark presence fill them with unspeakable might. This was no Elemental Fury-it was the raw hatred of Kil'jaeden sinking deep within the daggers. \n\nBlackhand could feel untamed agony radiating from the weapons. He named them Anguish and Sorrow, for he knew they would never be satisfied unless they were drinking the blood of new victims.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Five\n\nGul'dan was delighted with the daggers' power. Not only were they brimming with the dark presence of a Burning Legion lord, but they also were imbued with the means to control the will of the one who wielded them.\n\nTo test the weapons' potential, Gul'dan handed them to Garona and gave her a simple command. She obeyed instantly. An unfortunate Shadow Council acolyte had no chance to defend himself before she tore open his throat with one slash.\n\nIt was not a pleasant death. But it was fast, quiet, and efficient. When the orc took his last breath, the wound that killed him became irregular. Nobody would be able to tell whether he had died to a knife, an axe, or a spear. Gul'dan saw the possibilities immediately. A mysterious death could be used to sow confusion and redirect suspicion wherever he pleased. \n\nThese daggers would prove to be extremely valuable.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Six\n\nAs the Horde waged war on the draenei, Gul'dan dispatched Garona with care and precision. Influential orcs who expressed doubt or dissent were often found dead shortly after a skirmish with draenei forces. The wounds did not look as if they had come from orcish weapons, so Gul'dan was never suspected. \n\nNor was Garona. As a \"half-breed,\" she lived beneath the notice of most orcs, and those who noticed her saw only a servant of Gul'dan, held on a tight leash. \n\nHer quiet work aided the Horde in securing victory against the draenei, and then her blades helped maintain control in the war's aftermath. Life on Draenor withered due to the presence of fel magic, but tensions within the Horde stayed manageable. \n\nWhenever they didn't, Gul'dan gave the command, and Garona obeyed. Her daggers were busy.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Seven\n\nFor many years, Garona was bound to the will of the Shadow Council. She obeyed them to survive; she killed on their behalf to appease them. She often dreamed of using these daggers to slay her masters, but when she woke, her ensorcelled mind buried those thoughts, keeping her loyal.\n\nThat power, fortunately, seems to have died decades ago, along with Gul'dan in the Tomb of Sargeras. And to be clear, nobody is happier to see these daggers exacting payback from the Burning Legion than Garona.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Eight\n\nWhen the Horde invaded Azeroth, Gul'dan ordered Garona to find the sorcerer Medivh and keep an eye on him. In time, Garona would reveal herself to Khadgar, seeing humans as a potential means of escaping Gul'dan. \n\nHad she known that these daggers helped the warlock control her actions, she might have abandoned them, and history would have gone down a very different path. In the end, though she tried to resist, Gul'dan manipulated her into murdering the king of Stormwind, Llane Wrynn.\n\nGarona was now considered a traitor. She was forced to return to the Horde, bringing these daggers back with her.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Nine\n\nGarona did not receive a hero's welcome from the Horde. Warchief Blackhand had been killed by Orgrim Doomhammer in a mak'gora. Gul'dan was in a coma, and his Shadow Council was on the run. Garona was tortured for information on the Shadow Council's location.\n\nAs the Horde moved to finish off the human-led Alliance, Garona made her escape. With only these weapons and her survival instincts, she set out across Azeroth to find a new life. \n\nThe poor Horde trackers sent to hunt her down never really had a chance.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Ten\n\nEventually, as Garona was pulled into the events of the Second War, she began to understand the power these daggers were exerting on her will. Even so far away, she could feel Gul'dan trying to compel her back into his clutches.\n\nShe sought out the help of an undead mage named Meryl Winterstorm, asking him to hide the blades somewhere beyond anyone's reach. Garona wanted to make sure that no other victim would die to them, and that no other mind would be subject to Gul'dan's tricks.\n\nThese daggers remained buried for decades.\n\nThe Kingslayers, Part Eleven\n\nThese weapons do not have a history of glory. They did not earn honorable victories. They were meant to cause pain, and they have caused untold damage to both Draenor and Azeroth.\n\nRespect their power. Never forget the innocents who have died to them. \n\nMake the Burning Legion pay for every drop of blood their wielder was forced to spill.\n\nThe Dreadblades\n\nAs you probably guessed, these cutlasses were not forged on Azeroth. Be very careful with them. They were designed to trap weak, greedy minds. Though their master was sent back to the Twisting Nether, he may try to return and influence you in the future. Stay vigilant.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part One\n\nThe Bloodsail Buccaneers surely had no idea, at first, that they were meddling with the Burning Legion. By the end, it seems they assumed they had snatched a piece of forbidden power from under the demons' noses. But if they believed there would be no consequences for their \"gift,\" they were tragically mistaken.\n\nIt was not happenstance that these weapons fell into Admiral Goreblade's possession. It was planned and carefully executed by a Burning Legion commander who had plenty of experience corrupting fools and turning them against their own worlds. \n\nThese cutlasses were meant to do that here, on Azeroth.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Two\n\nThe eredar who created these cutlasses is named Talgath. It's impossible to say for certain when he first began to study Azeroth and its inhabitants, but it is certainly no accident that he crafted a pair of weapons that caught the eye of a pirate crew leader.\n\nTalgath's role in the Burning Legion is to help Kil'jaeden corrupt the native populations of different worlds. He has brought down countless civilizations, and he knows how to tempt mortal hearts. Sometimes he has found heroic champions who could be turned, but very often he has discovered willing minds among those who live on a world's fringes.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Three\n\nTalgath stumbled upon an effective method of corruption: find the selfish, the greedy, and the ruthless... and make them compete for power. Not only would he learn which among them were the strongest, but the \"winners\" would struggle so hard to obtain their prize that they would be unwilling to question its true cost until it was too late. \n\nAzeroth's pirates must have immediately seemed vulnerable to this tactic. They raided one another in search of treasure, giving little thought to the risks they would undertake.\n\nThe choice to create a pair of nimble cutlasses, the sort of weapons favored on the high seas, meant Talgath saw great potential in corrupting pirates to the Burning Legion's cause.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Four\n\nThese weapons first showed up on Azeroth a few decades ago. Several Alliance ships reported that they had escaped a band of pirates whose leader carried glowing blades oozing black smoke, and soon it became clear that those ships were the lucky ones. A newly empowered crew of pirates was preying on Alliance vessels, and when the raiders captured a ship, they left no survivors.\n\nGrand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the Eastern Kingdoms' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely human, but after a coordinated cannon barrage, Proudmoore sent their vessel, the Bellwether, to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe admiral sailed away, believing he had killed them all. In truth, one had survived.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Five\n\nThe single person who swam away from the sunken Bellwether was a teenage boy, a young pirate recruit who had seen his crew descend into corruption and madness firsthand. He had joined them for profit, so watching his captain and shipmates succumb to uncontrollable bloodlust had been a truly horrific experience.\n\nHe was compelled to retrieve these cutlasses from the ship's wreckage, but when he heard them whispering in his mind, he had the good sense to resist. He took the weapons and the treasure back to his crew's old lair and buried them deep underneath an isolated island. He believed the riches were cursed, and so he left them behind.\n\nThe weapons would remain buried for years.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Six\n\nIt took the upheaval of the Cataclysm to unearth these cutlasses again. A ship carrying some Bloodsail Buccaneers, a small but dangerous pirate crew, took shelter near a patch of tiny islands as the seas heaved to and fro. After the initial elemental unrest passed, their leader, Admiral Eliza Goreblade, noticed that rogue waves had revealed something beneath the sand.\n\nWhen they looked closer, they found a cache of gold, jewels, and old weapons. It was the last stash of the Bellwether, a windfall nobody knew had been missing.\n\nThe buccaneers gleefully took it all. Admiral Goreblade reserved a pair of gleaming cutlasses for herself, the only weapons in the cache that hadn't become rusted and worn over time. Unfortunately, that decision led her crew to ruin.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Seven\n\nAfter claiming these cutlasses, Goreblade was taken by a vision. She saw herself commanding an impossibly large pirate fleet, one that could conquer the high seas and all the nations of Azeroth. Every ship that dared to challenge her burned, and every city gave up its treasures or was destroyed.\n\nIt was an intoxicating sight, and she drank every drop of its promise. When she awoke, she had her crew set sail for a rival pirate hideout. The corrupted Bloodsail Buccaneers proceeded to slaughter all the unfortunate souls they found there.\n\nThe loot they took was secondary. The killing was what truly satisfied them. These weapons had taken root deep within their minds, and now there was no escape.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Eight\n\nGoreblade's buccaneers became an unseen, deadly menace on the South Seas. The master of these weapons, Talgath, had seen what attracting too much attention would do, so he encouraged Admiral Goreblade to attack only isolated ships and make certain they did not escape. \n\nFor several years, the pirate crew did exactly what they were told. They killed without mercy, and the power of the cutlasses grew ever stronger. When other Bloodsail Buccaneers learned how deep into insanity this crew had fallen, they tried to intervene. Goreblade's pirates survived the counterattack and managed to steal the Bloodsail Buccaneers' most prized ship, the Crimson Veil, for themselves.\n\nSoon, some crew members began to change. Their forms withered and faded. Only their skeletons remained.\n\nAdmiral Goreblade did not mind. The cutlasses hungered for blood, and now, so did she.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Nine\n\nShortly before the Legion's recent arrival, Admiral Goreblade finally discovered the true power behind her weapons. Talgath revealed himself and told her that she had only tasted a meaningless drop of the Burning Legion's strength. If she aided the demons in the coming war, he promised that she would ascend to immortality and find out what might the Legion could truly bestow.\n\nThe admiral agreed immediately. She made a pact, giving the souls of all her crew to Talgath's tender care.\n\nShe had already come to enjoy being the unseen terror of the seas. The possibility of bringing a world to ruin consumed her mind.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Ten\n\nWhen the Legion attacked, so did Admiral Goreblade. It now seems clear that several convoys of reinforcements--from both the Horde and the Alliance--were destroyed by her crew before they could reach the Broken Isles.\n\nIt is fortunate that the Bloodsail Buccaneers' true leader, Fleet Admiral Tethys, sought help. Had she been left unchecked, there is no telling what more damage Goreblade could have done to the Legion's enemies.\n\nAt least that threat is over.\n\nThe Dreadblades, Part Eleven\n\nTalgath, the master of these blades, was defeated. His spirit is back in the Twisting Nether, waiting to return. \n\nHis grip upon these cutlasses has been broken. The madness he infused into them, the thirst for blood, has been lessened. That does not mean he won't try to lay claim to the blades again.\n\nBut perhaps he will not. After all, he has plenty of reason to fear the creature who now possesses them.\n\nFangs of the Devourer\n\nExercise caution with these daggers. The assassin you killed, Akaari, paid a terrible price to wield them. Their history is filled with silent, secret murders across countless worlds, but never before have they been used by someone who still possessed their free will. \n\nYou will become one of the most dangerous killers the universe has ever known. Tread carefully.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part One\n\nThese daggers may have passed through the hands of a master weaponsmith, but their danger wasn't born of his hands. No. These are fangs, ancient yet well preserved, taken from the maw of a slain felhound. This creature was more dangerous than any of its like that we've ever seen. Indeed, it seems that this particular hound was the pet of the Great Enemy, Sargeras.\n\nHe must have cared deeply for this hound--in his own way--for he sculpted its power, gifting its sharp teeth with enough shadow energy to pierce reality itself. How many terrified innocents died to these fangs? We may never know. \n\nBut we do know this creature's name. Sargeras called it Goremaw the Devourer.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Two\n\nWhen the Legion invaded a new world, Goremaw would often accompany them, tearing enemy soldiers to shreds. Between battles, the felhound's eredar caretakers would collect the shadow energy dripping from its fangs, using it to craft powerful new weapons and reagents.\n\nGoremaw's end came on an unremarkable world. It had already been pacified, its leaders corrupted and its heroes slain. A child, burning with righteous fury for his dying world, crept into the Legion's stronghold and killed several eredar guards--and Goremaw--while they rested. When Sargeras saw his slain hound, he was consumed with rage. That world, and all who lived upon it, was scattered as ashes in the Great Dark. Such a quick death was perhaps a small mercy for them.\n\nBut though Goremaw had died, its usefulness to the Legion had not ended.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Three\n\nA dreadlord, Mephistroth, believed that Goremaw could still serve the Legion. He extracted the felhound's fangs and took them to a great demon forge on the eredar homeworld of Argus. There were many challenges in preserving the fangs' dark energies. Mephistroth dared not handle the task himself. His subordinates were eager to distinguish themselves, even at great risk. But the fangs' twisted power often proved too dangerous. When it pierced their minds and inflicted unspeakable agony, the dreadlord simply discarded them, giving their souls to the demon forge and finding another servant to take their place.\n\nBut in the end, their work was successful. The fangs had been sharpened to a permanent edge, their shadow powers preserved for all time.\n\nMephistroth had created two of the deadliest weapons the universe had ever known. These daggers could twist the air and bend light, allowing their wielders to conceal themselves effortlessly. He presented the daggers to Sargeras, who was greatly pleased. Goremaw had been a terror on the battlefield; in the hands of a skilled assassin, its fangs would be a terror in the shadows.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Four\n\nIt took time for Sargeras to find someone worthy of wielding the Fangs of the Devourer. Loyalty was a concern. Skilled assassins are deceptive by nature, all too capable of betrayal. Sargeras would not abide the thought of Goremaw's legacy falling into the hands of the Legion's enemies.\n\nConsider that for a moment: using these weapons against the Legion will be a personal affront to the Legion's lord.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Five\n\nFinally, Sargeras found someone suitable to carry these daggers into battle. An eredar tracker named Akaari had distinguished herself in several Legion invasions, silently murdering those who suspected that the demons' promises were laced with doom. \n\nShe was summoned to Argus and told of the great honor being offered to her. Sargeras promised Akaari that she would become a fearsome instrument of death, one of the deadliest creatures alive in any known realm. The price? Akaari would need to give up her will. If she wanted to be this living weapon, betrayal would become impossible. \n\nIt was a grim bargain, but Akaari accepted it.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Six\n\nThere are dark places beneath the surface of Argus. In these secret chambers, weapons are forged and wills are broken. Akaari spent centuries down there, her essence being shaped and molded, intertwined with the daggers' power. The souls of other eredar assassins were sacrificed and bound to hers, granting her the experience of a hundred lifetimes and thousands of kills.\n\nJust as Goremaw had been changed, so was she. She emerged from those chambers a remorseless construct of death, perfectly obedient to Sargeras. He knew that the daggers were safe in her hands, because her hands were an extension of his will. \n\nAnd in her hands, the daggers spelled doom for those who opposed the Burning Legion.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Seven\n\nSargeras had his eyes on a small, militaristic world. Its inhabitants would have fought hard against a Legion invasion. Though they would have fallen eventually to direct force, Sargeras believed they might be vulnerable to fear and paranoia. This world was Akaari's first mission with her newly granted powers. A test. She infiltrated its strongholds alone.\n\nWithin a month, the world was in chaos. Tales of an unseen assassin had spread like wildfire, and as heroes and leaders died silently, the world's warriors broke into factions, believing each other to blame for Akaari's assassinations.\n\nWhen the Legion finally revealed itself, the world begged to surrender. An eternity of servitude seemed better than living in fear of daggers striking from the shadows.\n\nAkaari had passed her test in stunning fashion. She was brought back into the ranks of the Legion to support their efforts directly.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Eight\n\nAkaari proved she was an indispensable ally. Her weapons allowed her to play with kings and other leaders like toys. Not only could she eliminate whom she wanted, but she could also take their place in disguise, perfectly mimicking their appearance and manner.\n\nA world does not fall because of a single assassin. But it certainly falls more quickly. A dagger through the right person's heart can win a battle or topple a kingdom. A panicked army that just lost its leader is more easily destroyed than a stalwart, determined force. \n\nThe Legion already had plenty of experience in corrupting weak minds and mortal hearts. Akaari was the demons' proof against failure. Whenever someone had the strength or the sense to resist temptation, Akaari's blades handled the rest.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Nine\n\nYes, Akaari was Sargeras's asset, loyal and unquestioning. But even though her will was gone, her guile remained. She requested that Sargeras allow her to roam the Twisting Nether for a time. He agreed, curious to see how she would further the goals of the Burning Legion. \n\nShe spent time skulking among the ranks of Sargeras's own armies, rooting out discontent and erasing ambitious demons who hoped to seize power at the Legion's expense. She became skilled in the art of interrogation, able to inflict untold pain and suffering upon any creature able to scream. She built a citadel on a dead world to hold prisoners and extract knowledge from them. \n\nOver time, her actions created malcontents within the Legion. The demons imagined her daggers in their throats, and their constant fear of her inspired thoughts of escape.\n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Ten\n\nWhen the location of Akaari's citadel became known to the rest of the Legion, she made a show of abandoning it. It had become useless, an unhelpful symbol. But it had served its purpose. She would return to the citadel in time, but only in secret, and only to prepare for particularly difficult invasions or to interrogate particularly important prisoners.\n\nShe returned to Sargeras with new skills and a new philosophy: fear was a double-edged sword, useful, but not always the right choice. An unseen assassin inspired terror, yes, but an unknown assassin inspired complacency. An enemy could not prepare to face a danger that seemingly did not exist.\n\nAkaari dedicated herself to becoming truly invisible. A silent killer. Her work continued.\n\nAnd then she met her end in her most secure stronghold. It was probably not the fate she imagined for herself. \n\nFangs of the Devourer, Part Eleven\n\nWe may never know what compelled Akaari to sacrifice her free will in service to Sargeras. But there can be no doubt that she served him well. \n\nShe embraced the intricacies of fear and knew how to strike it into the hearts of her victims. When confronting those without fear, she skillfully eliminated them. When terror became counterproductive, she learned how to kill without being noticed at all.\n\nThese lessons were once employed by the Burning Legion. Now they belong to its enemies. \n\nOnly time will tell how Sargeras will respond.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on! There's more information to be uncovered in these texts.

By now, Instructor Razuvious has likely begun teaching you the first lessons of what it means to be a death knight. Allow me to begin your instruction on what is perhaps the most guarded treasure in a death knight's possession; the runeblade.\n\nWithout your hand to guide it, your runeblade is but a hollow shell. Separate, you are both broken entities; weak and powerless. Should you ever find yourself without possession of a runeblade, know then that your only task should be the acquisition of another with all due haste.\n\nAs a death knight, it is through your runeblade that your will shall be imposed on all who dare resist the Lich King. For just as you, young death knight are the extension through which the Lich King imposes his will, so is your runeblade the instrument that has been granted the honor in delivering this authority. Of this authority, understand these principles:\n\n1.) United, your runeblade becomes an extension of your very body. And your body belongs to the Lich King.\n\n2.) As one, your runeblade becomes your will manifest in physical form. And your will is that of the Lich King.\n\n3.) Together, your runeblade becomes the vein through which death itself is delivered to your soul. And your soul shall deliver the will of the Lich King.\n\nThrough the course of your training, you may find yourself compelled to focus upon some of the different disciplines of study available to our kind. On this matter I can only say this; all are worthy of study and to neglect some at the cost of others is a foolish pride that I have seen cost other, less capable death knights in battle their lives.\n\nIt is likely that some of you may soon find your runeblade to be a particularly potent object through which to channel your own fury. However, this is not enough. Do not be content to believe that your runeblade is simply a mere tool to focus one's meditation. No, it is far more than that. The most powerful of our kind have been able to command the power of their blade with but a simple extension of their will. Together they fight, of singular mind, body, and purpose to crush any foolish enough to stand in their way.\n\nOthers may find that their blade responds most eagerly when infused with the power of an icy chill. In this way, even the sharpest of runeblades will find themselves made even more potent. The same power that permeates our glorious citadel of Icecrown is yours to command, death knight. Should you choose to master this discipline, there shall be no escape for your enemies, as they find their actions slowed and made impossible by the cold.\n\nStill others may find their true calling in mastering the power of their blades to bring about disease and plague in crushing our enemies. This too is a specialty unique to our kind and worthy of pursuit. The mightiest of defenses may seem impregnable at first, yet for every defense therein lies the weakness that it is covering. It is simply a matter of uncovering it.

We must embrace extraordinary new tactics. If not, we will die. It is as simple as that.\n\nPerhaps you consider Illidan an arrogant sorcerer, or even a menace to our way of life.

All failed.\n\nLet their shortcomings serve as a lesson and a warning. Noble intentions are not enough to harness this staff's formidable power. You must sharpen your focus to a blade's edge, and make your will as unyielding as steel. For the moment your discipline falters, this weapon will claim you as it has all others.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part One\n\nYears ago, the fanatical Scarlet Crusade set out to create a staff of unparalleled holy might. A weapon that would rival even the legendary Ashbringer in righteous fury.\n\nThe Ashbringer derived its power from a shadowy artifact that had been purified in the Light and affixed to the blade. The Scarlet Crusade sought to do the same for its staff.\n\nThe order sent its most loyal crusaders into the war-torn Plaguelands in search of a suitable relic. The few who returned bore a strange jewel bristling with darkness. Some sources say it had been part of a truncheon carried by one of the first death knights to walk the world. Other accounts hint that the dreaded lich Kel'Thuzad had shaped the jewel with his spectral hands.\n\nWhatever the truth, the Crusade would use the black gem to create the staff known as Light's Wrath.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Two\n\nTen of the Scarlet Crusade's learned priests gathered in Hearthglen to create Light's Wrath. For weeks, they practiced a ritual that would purify the dark jewel and bind it to the staff.\n\nWhat they never accounted for was a demon in their midst.\n\nA nathrezim named Balnazzar had infiltrated the Crusade and assumed the identity of its leader, Saidan Dathrohan. When the demon learned of the plans to forge Light's Wrath, he feared that such a weapon could unmask his deception and shatter his hold over the Crusade.\n\nBalnazzar disrupted the cleansing ritual, and the crusaders lost control of their delicate spellwork. A storm of holy energy ripped through the meeting place, instantly killing the ten priests. Yet Light's Wrath was left intact. The blast had purified the jewel and affixed it to the staff.\n\nUpon close inspection, Balnazzar found that the staff trembled with unstable energies. Wielding it with any reliability would be near impossible. Rather than destroy the weapon, the demon allowed the Scarlet Crusade to keep it. He looked forward to the mayhem it would cause in the years to come.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Three\n\nA letter from Grand Inquisitor Isillien to High General Abbendis of the Scarlet Crusade:\n\n\"I received your last letter, and I understand your concerns. But in terms of raw power, Light's Wrath has surpassed our wildest expectations. The recent battle near Tyr's Hand is proof of this.\n\n\"The Scourge outnumbered our righteous warriors twenty to one. It would have been a massacre if not for Light's Wrath. The staff's blazing light carved through the Scourge like a scythe through wheat, leaving none behind.\n\n\"It is true that Light's Wrath killed its wielder and many of the soldiers at his side. It is also true that the surviving crusaders have been left dumbstruck, unable to dress or feed themselves without assistance.\n\n\"But at a ratio of twenty to one, I consider such losses acceptable.\"\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Four\n\nFrom The Hunt for Light's Wrath, compiled by the Kirin Tor of Dalaran:\n\n\"Detected another explosion of holy energy in the Plaguelands. The fifth in the last year. This recent disaster bears all the similarities of the others. Light's Wrath is to blame.\n\n\"From what I can gather, the Scarlet Crusade raided a small village in search of the Scourge. They used Light's Wrath to 'cleanse' the living townsfolk, thinking they were afflicted by the plague of undeath.\n\n\"This went on for some time before the priest using the staff lost control of its power. What was once the town square is now nothing more than a smoldering crater, filled to the brim with bodies.\n\n\"As before, the weapon was gone by the time I arrived. Some other fool Crusader likely has it.\n\n\"I should have never volunteered for this task.\n\n\"-Israen of the Kirin Tor\"\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Five\n\nOf all the Scarlet Crusaders who bore Light's Wrath, Inquisitor Halbin had the greatest chance of success. His discipline and calculated focus were unmatched among the order's members.\n\nIn the Scarlet Monastery, Halbin put the staff's powers to use, torturing Forsaken prisoners. He seared his captives with holy fire, extracting information for the Crusade to utilize in its war against the undead. The more Halbin interacted with the Forsaken, the more he grew to loathe the cursed beings. He no longer cared about gathering intelligence from them. He simply wanted to hear their screams.\n\nDuring one night of feverish torture, Halbin's anger overwhelmed his thoughts. His hold over Light's Wrath slipped. It was only for an instant. That was all it took to seal the inquisitor's doom.\n\nAn explosion rocked the torture chamber and engulfed Halbin in holy fire. It is said he died a slow death, his howls of agony ringing through the monastery for days on end.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Six\n\nIt is unknown exactly when Light's Wrath slipped between the Scarlet Crusade's fingers. Eventually, the staff fell to the care of a priest named Jakhar. The devout troll was a member of the Horde Expedition, a mighty force sent to wage war against the Scourge in Northrend.\n\nAboard a zeppelin en route to the warfront, Jakhar practiced harnessing Light's Wrath. She dreamed of smiting the Scourge with the weapon, of making the undead pay for all the lives they had destroyed.\n\nOver Northrend, a fierce storm knocked the zeppelin from the sky, and the dirigible plummeted to the icy tundra. Though every passenger survived the crash, they had no time to celebrate. They had landed deep within Scourge territory.\n\nJakhar's intense training paid off. She wielded Light's Wrath with precision and decimated the Scourge. Under her guidance, the Horde fighters carved a path through the enemy lines and reached safety.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Seven\n\nIn Northrend, Jakhar became the bane of the Scourge. She purified the land of undead with Light's Wrath, leaving a trail of holy fire wherever she went. Her heroics earned her high praise from the Horde's commanders, but Jakhar was not satisfied with words alone.\n\nNo matter how many members of the Scourge she destroyed, it was never enough. Jakhar always wanted more. She became single-minded in her quest, often putting her Horde allies at risk.\n\nThough she cleansed more and more undead, there was a price. With each day that passed, thoughts of retribution consumed her... and her iron hold over Light's Wrath began to slip.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Eight\n\nFrom The Hunt for Light's Wrath, compiled by the Kirin Tor of Dalaran:\n\n\"Another incident. This time in Northrend.\n\n\"A Horde priest named Jakhar found the staff. By all accounts, very knowledgeable in the Light. Remarkably, she used the weapon for some time against the Scourge before the accident.\n\n\"Jakhar led a small force of Horde deep behind Scourge lines. The priest wreaked havoc on the undead before she lost control of Light's Wrath. A lance of holy magic erupted from the weapon, injuring the Horde soldiers and permanently blinding Jakhar. They barely made it back alive.\n\n\"The troll seems quite humbled by the ordeal. She has vowed to spend the remainder of the war using her powers to heal, rather than to destroy.\n\n\"Regarding the staff, Jakhar and the other soldiers abandoned it while retreating from Scourge territory. If I have any luck at all, the weapon will be where they left it, out there in the wastes.\n\n\"Good thing I packed my winter robes.\n\n\"-Israen of the Kirin Tor\"\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Nine\n\nAfter Jakhar abandoned the staff in Northrend, Light's Wrath found its way back to the Eastern Kingdoms. The staff passed from one owner to the next. Kindhearted priests and paladins bore the weapon to heal the sick and protect the innocent, but none could wield it for very long.\n\nIn time, the mysterious Dark Riders learned of its whereabouts. These hooded horsemen originated from the tower of Karazhan. They spent their days stalking the land, procuring artifacts and relics of great power.\n\nA Dark Rider named Ariden was the first to try to take up Light's Wrath... and the last. The moment his cursed hand touched the staff, a wave of holy energy erupted from the weapon. So pure was the magic that it drove the Dark Riders away and sent them slinking back to their haunted tower.\n\nIt was one of the few artifacts they would ever willingly abandon. Perhaps the only one.\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Ten\n\nFrom The Hunt for Light's Wrath, compiled by the Kirin Tor of Dalaran:\n\n\"Praise the Light, the staff is finally in my grasp.\n\n\"I tracked Light's Wrath to the cultists of the Twilight's Hammer. They had recovered the staff and were planning to reverse the purification ritual performed on it some years ago. In so doing, the cultists would have transformed Light's Wrath into its antithesis: a weapon of pure darkness.\n\n\"I stormed the Twilight's Hammer encampment just before the cultists completed their ritual. Their resistance was short lived, and I dealt with them quite handily. Far be it from me to brag, though I think I have earned the right to after this mad quest.\n\n\"Expect me in Dalaran shortly with this blasted staff.\n\n\"-Israen of the Kirin Tor\"\n\nLight's Wrath, Part Eleven\n\nAn untitled missive from the Kirin Tor's archives, author unknown:\n\n\"I report with great sadness that Israen has perished.\n\n\"While preparing Light's Wrath for transport to Dalaran, he inadvertently triggered its powers. It seems the spell he cast to lock the staff in a protective shield caused an explosion of holy energy.\n\n\"I know this comes as quite a shock. Israen was always an attentive and calculating man. He knew more about the staff than any of us. But perhaps that knowledge made him careless.\n\n\"We have taken precautions so that we do not repeat his mistake. Seven magi have sealed Light's Wrath in dampening runes. We will arrive in Dalaran soon to deposit the staff in the Nexus Vault.\"\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru\n\nT'uure is one of the purest physical embodiments of the Light in existence. The dynamic energies that flow through this artifact can heal wounds both physical and mental. They can inspire hope in times of overwhelming darkness, and fortify timid hearts with courage.\n\nBut perhaps T'uure's greatest strength is what we can learn from its past. If there is one thing to take away from its history, it is this: even one brave soul wielding the Light can save the lives of thousands.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part One\n\nThe draenei have many legends about the benevolent naaru. Few are as cherished as the tale of T'uure.\n\nLike other naaru, T'uure vowed to protect all mortal civilizations in the universe from the clutches of darkness. This noble quest eventually led the holy being to a world called Karkora. Its mortal denizens faced annihilation at the hands of a monstrous entity known as Dimensius the All-Devouring.\n\nAs Dimensius shrouded Karkora in Void energies, T'uure expended its own life force to spare the world from doom. The naaru shattered into fragments and sparked a colossal holy nova. The energy cascaded over Karkora, washing away the void and banishing Dimensius from the world.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Two\n\nFrom the draenei holy tome entitled Lessons in Hope and Sacrifice:\n\n\"T'uure had shattered, but even broken, its Light was undiminished. Each piece blazed like a star, drawing naaru from the far corners of creation. They scooped up T'uure's glittering fragments, and they sang songs of the sacrifice that had saved a world.\n\n\"The naaru gifted these shards to various races that they believed showed potential for good. The largest piece of T'uure was passed to our own ancestors: the ancient eredar of Argus.\n\n\"It is said that this artifact plummeted from the sky like a falling star. Night turned to day, and T'uure's glorious Light painted the heavens in shades of gold for a full week.\"\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Three\n\nThe eredar were a highly erudite people who cherished learning, and they studied T'uure with great curiosity. The first among them to truly harness the artifact's power for good was the wise leader named Velen.\n\nDuring Velen's time, a strange curse spread across Argus. The victims found their minds addled, their memories diminished. Few things terrified the eredar as much as losing their precious knowledge. They reacted with fear and paranoia. To prevent others from contracting the affliction, many of the eredar considered quarantining the cursed or even banishing them from Argus.\n\nYet Velen would not abandon his people. At great risk to himself, he walked among the cursed with T'uure in hand. Velen called upon the artifact's powers and cured all of the stricken eredar.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Four\n\nAn excerpt from The Corruption of the Eredar and the Flight of the Draenei, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"When Sargeras came to Argus to corrupt the eredar, nearly all fell under his sway. Velen and his followers were the exception. With the naaru's help, they embarked on a harrowing escape from their home. The going was not easy. Demons awaited the fleeing eredar at every corner.\n\n\"Despair gripped the renegades, and many even considered giving up. It was during this dark and trying time that Velen brought T'uure to bear. Its brilliant energies shone before the renegades and renewed their dwindling confidence. Emboldened by the artifact, Velen's followers believed that they could do the impossible, that they could complete their daring flight from Argus. And so they did.\n\n\"From that day forward, the renegades called themselves the draenei. It is a name that everyone on Azeroth now knows. But if not for T'uure, perhaps the draenei would have never come to be.\"\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Five\n\nAboard a dimensional fortress called the Genedar, the draenei fled across the stars. The demons pursued them relentlessly, determined to punish the renegades for escaping corruption.\n\nThe long millennia that followed were harsh on the draenei. They could not rest. The threat of capture haunted their dreams. To defend themselves against the Legion, many turned to T'uure and other holy artifacts brought from Argus. The draenei studied these relics and honed their connection to the Light under the tutelage of Velen and the naaru.\n\nA student named Askara showed more promise than the rest. In time, she would earn the right to carry T'uure, and she would become one of the greatest healers the draenei would ever know.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Six\n\nAskara had lost her entire family on Argus, but she found a new one aboard the Genedar. She saw the draenei as her brothers and sisters, and she vowed to do whatever she could to protect them.\n\nYet she was not gifted with physical strength or a talent for forging armaments. Instead, she turned to the Light. Her mastery of holy magic became so great that Velen eventually gave T'uure to her. Askara spent her every waking hour studying the artifact and unlocking its extraordinary potential.\n\nIt was during this time that Askara received a vision of the future. She foresaw her people finding a sanctuary from the Legion. A new life. A new world to call home.\n\nBut strangely, she did not see herself there.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Seven\n\nThe draenei visited many different worlds in search of a safe haven, but they rarely stayed for very long before the Burning Legion would learn of their whereabouts. Before the demons could confront them, the draenei would gather aboard the Genedar and disappear into the stars once again.\n\nThe Legion's relentless pursuit bred depression and pessimism in many draenei, but they did not suffer in silence. Askara sought out her forlorn kin and spoke to them of their troubles. She carried T'uure with her at all times, the relic casting an aura of holy magic around her that lifted the other draenei's spirits.\n\n\"It is true that the Legion is vast and mighty, but they do not stand in the Light as we do,\" Askara often said. \"No matter how strong our enemy is, if they walk in darkness, they will always stumble and fall.\"\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Eight\n\nFrom the draenei holy tome entitled The Second Sun of Shar'gel:\n\n\"The Burning Legion had lain in wait for us on Shar'gel, watching as we disembarked from the Genedar and set foot on the world. We believed we had found a place to settle. A place to start over again.\n\n\"We were wrong.\n\n\"Fel portals screamed open all around us, spewing forth doomguards, felhounds, and other horrors. The Legion's forces cornered us, cutting off our retreat to the Genedar. I thought we were done for.\n\n\"Then I saw... her. I saw Askara.\n\n\"She planted herself between us and the demons, T'uure held high. A storm of light erupted around her, blinding the Legion's minions and shielding us from their fel-touched blades. As we battled our way to the Genedar, T'uure grew brighter and brighter until it shone like a second sun on Shar'gel.\"\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Nine\n\nWhen the Burning Legion beset the draenei on Shar'gel, Askara finally understood the strange vision of the future she had seen so long ago. One day, her people would locate a new home, but she was not fated to join them. She would die on Shar'gel to give them a chance to find that sanctuary.\n\nAskara and seventy other draenei volunteered to distract the Legion. With their blood, they would buy the rest of the renegades the time to escape Shar'gel. The battle between the demons and these brave defenders would go down as one of the greatest instances of self-sacrifice in draenei history.\n\nHundreds of demons smashed into the seventy-one like a battering ram of fel-forged steel, but the defenders gave no ground. Not a single inch. Every time a draenei teetered on the brink of death, Askara was there. She charged through the battle lines and mended the wounded with T'uure's holy Light.\n\nBecause of Askara, the seventy-one fought with the courage and strength of a thousand. Because of her, the draenei race escaped annihilation.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Ten\n\nAfter the Battle of Shar'gel, T'uure fell into the Burning Legion's hands. The demons had witnessed Askara's heroic last stand, and they attributed her immense power to the strange artifact. Legion forces squabbled over control of the relic before Kil'jaeden the Deceiver finally decided whom it would go to.\n\nHe entrusted the artifact to an eredar priestess named Lady Calindris. She was one of the few demons who understood the draenei's holy magics. What was more, Calindris had an intimate knowledge of T'uure itself. Long ago on Argus, the priestess had acted as a caretaker of the eredar's holy relics.\n\nIt took years before Calindris finally bent T'uure to her will. After a series of grim rituals, she transformed the artifact into a dark reflection of itself. Where once T'uure inspired hope, now it would spread fear. Where once the relic healed, now it would cause wounds to fester.\n\nT'uure, Beacon of the Naaru, Part Eleven\n\nLady Calindris relished bending T'uure to her will and using its corrupted power against her foes. She loathed the draenei, and the thought of befouling their cherished artifact delighted her to no end.\n\nCalindris grew so talented at wielding T'uure that the demon lord Kil'jaeden gave her a special task. She would serve as a torturer on the Legion's prison worlds. Calindris was well suited for this role. She made an art out of inflicting suffering on her captives, and images of T'uure filled their nightmares.\n\nMuch like Askara, Calindris eventually received a vision of the future. She foresaw the Legion invading the world of Azeroth and bathing it in fel fire. Strangely, Calindris herself was not there.\n\nBut T'uure was. A stranger wielded the artifact in its glorious true form, and its Light blinded the Legion's forces, shining over the land like a second sun.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire\n\nAn ancient and terrible force trembles deep within Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire. Though this dagger can serve as a powerful tool for those who wield shadow magic, tread cautiously.\n\nXal'atath has a mind of its own. Ignore its maddening whispers. Do not trust the lies it spins. Take from it what you need, but always remember that the dark presence in the blade is not your ally.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part One\n\nXal'atath had its dark genesis in an age long before the Horde and the Alliance, an age when the legendary Old Gods and their Black Empire engulfed the world in shadow.\n\nThere are many theories concerning the blade's creation. The more outlandish claim that it is all that remains of a forgotten Old God who was consumed by its kin in the early days of the Black Empire. Other theories state that Xal'atath is the claw of Y'Shaarj, ripped from the Old God's monstrous form and bestowed upon its servants for use in ritual sacrifices.\n\nAs unbelievable as these stories are, perhaps there is truth to them. Xal'atath pulses with the foul essence of the Old Gods. It is even said that the blade can grant its owner visions of the Black Empire, but all who have looked upon such horrors have lost themselves to madness.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Two\n\nMighty beings known as the titan-forged eventually defeated the Black Empire. They shackled the Old Gods and their minions in prisons beneath the earth. Harmony descended on Azeroth, but it was not to last.\n\nXal'atath made sure of that.\n\nThe blade remained in the world, passing from mortal hand to mortal hand and leaving only death and chaos in its wake. One of the unfortunate souls who took up Xal'atath was a troll named Zan'do. The ambitious witch doctor hailed from the mighty Gurubashi tribe. His rivals had ousted him from a position of power and prestige, and Zan'do spent his days nursing dreams of retribution.\n\nIt was a simple thing for Xal'atath to latch onto Zan'do's anger and twist him into a pawn.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Three\n\nGuided by Xal'atath's whispers, Zan'do and a handful of loyal witch doctors sought out a strange mound of blackened stone. Troll mystics had forbidden their people from disturbing this site, but Zan'do ignored the taboo. He believed the mound held great power-power he could use to defeat his rivals.\n\nHe and his followers would soon discover what the mound really was: the body of a slumbering servant of the Old Gods named Kith'ix.\n\nXal'atath urged Zan'do to make blood offerings to the creature. With his mind corrupted by the blade, the witch doctor did not hesitate. He dismembered some of his companions with the dagger, and then he used their blood and organs as reagents to awaken the monstrosity. In a final act, Zan'do buried his gore-stained dagger into Kith'ix's hide... and the giant rumbled to life.\n\nZan'do and his followers were never seen again. Trolls would later visit the site and find only scattered bones picked clean of flesh.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Four\n\nAfter Kith'ix awakened, it brought the shadow of war upon Azeroth. The monstrous creature rallied other Old God minions to its side and launched a campaign to grind troll civilization into dust.\n\nUnlike the trolls who had roused it, Kith'ix knew how to harness Xal'atath's true potential. Calling on the blade's power, the C'Thrax spread pestilence among the trolls to weaken their bodies, and it bombarded them with visions of death to weaken their minds.\n\nThough the trolls would eventually destroy Kith'ix and defeat its armies, Xal'atath would haunt the dreams of the war's survivors until the end of their days. Many tribes would recount legends about the black blade that had nearly driven them to extinction.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Five\n\nFrom chapter four of Modgud's Doom, concerning the day the Dark Iron sorceress acquired Xal'atath:\n\n\"Modgud embraced her clan's long history of studying arcane magic. As the wife of Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan, she had first pick of the Dark Irons' most powerful enchanted artifacts. Yet she was never quite satisfied with the offerings on hand. Modgud would often dispatch her servants to find new relics that she could study and use as instruments in the creation of spells.\n\n\"One of these dwarves returned with a blade that thrummed with dark energy. Modgud was immediately taken by it. For days, she retreated into her archives to unravel the dagger's mysteries. At times, she could be seen talking to the weapon. When she later emerged, Modgud called for the dwarf who had brought the blade in order to thank him.\n\n\"No one could find him. No one could even remember his name or his face. It was as if he had simply vanished into thin air.\"\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Six\n\nFrom chapter twenty-three of Modgud's Doom, concerning the battle between the Dark Iron clan and the Wildhammer clan in Grim Batol:\n\n\"War golems smashed through Grim Batol's gates, and the Dark Iron soldiers poured into the Wildhammer capital. Bitter rivals these two clans were. Neither side showed the other mercy.\n\n\"The Wildhammers' bravery was their greatest weapon, and Modgud sought to take that from them. Under the thunderous clash of hammer against axe, she screamed an incantation and wove her profane spellwork. She slid her enchanted dagger over her palm and let her blood spill onto the stones.\n\n\"Modgud's foul ritual brought Grim Batol's shadows to life. They sprang from the city's dark nooks and crannies, falling upon the Wildhammers with blades forged of night.\"\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Seven\n\nFrom chapter twenty-seven of Modgud's Doom, recounting the final moments of the Dark Iron invasion of Grim Batol:\n\n\"By some feat of courage, Thane Khardros rallied his remaining Wildhammer warriors and launched a desperate counterattack against the Dark Irons. Khardros bulled through his enemies with the single-minded focus of a war golem, only coming to a stop when he found Modgud.\n\n\"Here, the fate of Wildhammer and Dark Iron would be decided.\n\n\"The sorceress unleashed her dark power on Khardros, but he pressed his attack. Then Modgud reached for her black blade-the weapon that had turned Grim Batol into a den of nightmare. It was not there.\n\n\"She had lost her cherished weapon. Or, as some would claim, the weapon had abandoned her.\n\n\"With one mighty blow of his hammer, Khardros mortally wounded Modgud and secured victory for the Wildhammers. It is said that as the sorceress lay dying, she repeated one phrase over and over again: 'You promised...'\"\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Eight\n\nDecades after Modgud lost Xal'atath, the blade was taken up by a human bishop named Natalie Seline. She had lived through the First War, when the orcish Horde invaded Azeroth and conquered Stormwind.\n\nAfter the war, Seline realized that to defeat the green-skinned orcs, humanity would need to study the strange powers they wielded. She closely examined their magics, and she visited battle sites where their dark arts had befouled the land.\n\nFrom her investigations, she learned of an otherworldly blade that the orcs had once used in their bloody rituals-a blade that held sway over the shadows themselves. Troubled that such a profane weapon could exist, Seline swore to hunt it down and destroy it in the name of the Light.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Nine\n\nFrom The Secrets of the Void, by Natalie Seline:\n\n\"The moment I touched the blade, a name was spoken in my mind: Xal'atath. I knew then that I could not destroy the dagger. Not yet. How can one defeat a power she does not understand?\n\n\"And I had much to understand. Very much indeed. Xal'atath whispered to me in waking and in dreaming. It taught me that there is more to this world than Light. There is also Void.\n\n\"In the ebb and flow between these two forces, one can find power and knowledge beyond anything the Church of the Holy Light has ever revealed to us. One can cross the divide between Light and Void. One can pull strands from each side and weave a tapestry of day and night.\n\n\"Of course, there are consequences. There always are when walking in the shadows.\"\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Ten\n\nBy the time of the Second War, Natalie Seline had learned how to wield shadow magic from Xal'atath. She had taught her dangerous arts to other worshipers of the Light and rallied them against the Horde. Seline and her followers waged their war in secret, hunting down orcs across the human kingdoms.\n\nXal'atath continued whispering in Seline's mind, slowly unraveling her sanity. Despite her noble intentions, she became more and more obsessed with the blade and the mysteries of the Void.\n\nAnd so did Seline's companions. They were overzealous in their campaign against the orcs, putting innocent lives at risk. Some strayed too far into shadow, forsaking the Light completely. Though Seline urged her followers to use caution, her calls were ignored and even treated with suspicion.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what happened to the former bishop, but some sources state that Xal'atath incited rebellion among her allies. It convinced them that Seline was holding them back from their true potential--holding back knowledge and power that they could have if they killed her.\n\nIn the dead of night, the conspirators murdered Seline and then took Xal'atath for themselves.\n\nXal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire,Part Eleven\n\nFor years, the Kirin Tor magi in Dalaran had watched Natalie Seline, greatly troubled by her dark teachings. After her death, they set out to scour her writings from history. Magi picked through the villages and cities Seline had traveled, gathering up every scroll and tome that she had penned.\n\nThe Kirin Tor hid these writings in Dalaran, hoping that would be the end of Seline's dangerous brand of magic. Yet despite their efforts, they could not bury the doctrine of balance she had preached. In the years to come, others would take up her teachings and devote themselves to the Light and the Void.\n\nThe magi also knew of Xal'atath, but they never found it. Like Seline's teachings, the blade would not simply fade away.\n\nIt had more minds to twist, more pawns to use, and more innocents to terrorize.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on.

I entreat these restless minds to brood no longer, as no one can be filled with more loathing of his previous errors than I. Yet in the Scourge I have found absolution.\n\nIn my ignorance, I was once a paladin pledged to the hateful Light. Blinded with lies about hope, I left my wife and two young daughters at home whilst I scouted for Scourge presence in our area. Our petty band searched the woods for weeks, but every trail went cold. Winter set in and still we had learned nothing about the enemy. Frustrated, we turned homeward.\n\nAscending the final hill revealed a terrifying vista. The village lay burnt and deformed. I ran to our house. A makeshift bolt had been nailed across the outside of the door. Too distressed to wonder at this, I burst in to find the remains of my family prostrate at my feet, charred beyond recognition. I turned away in anguish, and beheld the gashes in the door where they had clawed in panic. The smallest scratches had belonged to the youngest.\n\nI later learned that in our absence, rumors had flown that a plaguebearer was hiding around the village. The Scarlet Crusade had seen to it that every last inhabitant was rounded up and burned alive. Unthinkable though their cruelty was, I found that the same feeling now stirred inside my breast. I yearned to hunt down the Crusaders, to make them suffer the rage of my blade.\n\nEventually, I was made to reassemble with the rest of my party. I sensed my own despondence and fury in some of the others, but the leaders ordered us to continue to the nearest remaining waypost. Not long after nightfall, we heard the ominous cackling of the undead echoing from the trees, and a wave of Scourge overtook us.\n\nMechanically, I slew them. But for each of the fallen, two more crawled forth from the hills. We were caught in the same tide of Scourge we had been hunting, only now we were broken and unprepared. My allies were succumbing to wounds and exhaustion. There were too many Scourge to resist now.\n\nAs the blows came, I remembered playing in these woods with my daughters. It filled me with hatred. Why must such memories exist? They were an illusion, serving only to distract me from the reality of pain and dissolution. My daughters were dead and the field overrun with Scourge. Death is the only real end to any mortal tale. Wielding power to protect leads inalterably to failure. Success meets only those who use it for a different end...\n\nThen and there, I swore allegiance to the Lich King, the herald of victory in our age. He purged me of the hateful human sensations that had tormented me. I was reborn as a death knight. There is no force to which my brethren and I will fall. There are no defeats bitter enough to test my icy resolve.

Do we not show respect by ensuring that our prey's death was not in vain?\" she asked. \"Should we not use everything the Earthmother has to offer? We can strengthen our armor two-fold if we use the rest of the animal in our construction.\"\n\nThe elders spoke quietly for a moment amongst themselves, then looked up to Leyota.\n\n\"To change tradition is to change our way of life.

Armed with an immense hammer, Tyr helped his kin break the strength of the Old Gods and their dark armies. He forged a glorious new destiny for Azeroth. \n\nTyr was a warrior without equal, but his greatest trait was his conviction. He never gave up. He never strayed from his titan-bestowed quest. The mere sight of his argent hammer on the battlefield inspired courage in everyone who fought at his side.\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Two\n\nFrom the writings of an order known as Tyr's Guard, recounting Keeper Tyr and Keeper Odyn's mythic battle against Ragnaros the Firelord:\n\n\"Ragnaros retreated to the heart of his lair, where he was most powerful, and waited for his enemies to come to him. He called fire from the sky to waylay Tyr and Odyn. Smoke descended on the land, and it became like night.\n\n\"A single brilliant light shone in the darkness-the silvery glow of Tyr's great hammer. It drifted to and fro, sometimes forward and sometimes back. The erratic movements confused Ragnaros. He gradually let his guard down, believing Tyr and Odyn were too cowardly to face him in battle.\n\n\"It was exactly what the keepers had been waiting for. \n\n\"Like a bolt of lightning, Tyr pierced through the smoke and scored a blow against Ragnaros with his hammer. Odyn then flanked the staggered Firelord, and the two keepers overwhelmed their foe.\"\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Three\n\nFrom chapter three of The Age of Galakrond, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"As great a warrior as Tyr was, he did not always escape his battles unharmed. An example of this was his confrontation with the monstrous proto-dragon named Galakrond.\n\n\"Countless years after the keepers defeated the Old Gods and imprisoned them beneath the earth, Galakrond emerged to rule the skies of the world. A fierce hunger compelled the proto-dragon to eat everything in his path. \n\n\"When Tyr learned about the creature, he feared Galakrond would soon devour all nature. He gathered five other proto-dragons to wage war on him.\n\n\"Though the five proto-dragons would eventually vanquish Galakrond, their initial attacks on him went poorly. Tyr's new allies did not always work together. Even when they did, Galakrond proved too mighty for the combined strength of the keeper and the proto-dragons.\n\nIn one battle, Tyr himself grappled with Galakrond and pummeled the beast with his hammer. The blows had little effect. Tyr's weapon was knocked from his grasp, and Galakrond consumed the keeper's hand.\n\n\"Only with the help of his five winged allies did Tyr escape with his life.\"\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Four\n\nFrom chapter nine of The Age of Galakrond, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"Keeper Tyr worked with a giant named Jotun to replace his appendage. They mined a vein of pure silver deep within Azeroth. Jotun used the metal to forge a hand for his injured companion. \n\n\"Tyr was in awe of Jotun's craftsmanship, and he asked the giant for one final favor: to reforge his warhammer so that it would incorporate the image of his new hand. The giant did so, but he inquired why the keeper wanted to draw more attention to his wound.\n\n\"Tyr replied that he did not consider his argent hand a reminder of defeat. For him it was a symbol of the sacrifice he had made to defend Azeroth, and he wanted the world to see it that way as well.\n\n\"When Jotun finished reshaping the hammer, Tyr named his weapon the Silver Hand.\"\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Five\n\nAs the ages passed on Azeroth, the unity between Tyr and his fellow keepers crumbled.\n\nKeeper Loken fell under the sway of the imprisoned Old God Yogg-Saron. The once-noble giant turned on his kin, leaving many of them incapacitated or imprisoned. Loken's betrayal ignited chaos among the earthen, vrykul, and other titan-forged creatures who served the keepers.\n\nOnly Tyr and a handful of his closest allies eluded Loken's wrath. Though they planned to strike down the corrupted keeper, they first needed to find a refuge for the earthen and their other innocent servants. Tyr rallied the titan-forged to his side and ventured south in search of a place that was safe from Loken's reach.\n\nThe journey was harsh, and many of the titan-forged worried for the future. Only the sight of Tyr leading the way, his legendary hammer always in hand, gave them the hope they needed to continue. \n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Six\n\nNearly all of Tyr's followers traveled south, but not Jotun. Inspired by the keeper's ideals of personal sacrifice, the giant stayed behind to distract Loken and help mask his allies' escape.\n\nJotun succeeded, but he was punished for his heroics. \n\nWhen Loken learned that many of the titan-forged had fled south, he captured Jotun and twisted his mind. The cursed giant was forced to search the lands surrounding Ulduar and destroy Tyr, anything that symbolized his power, and anyone who followed his ideals.\n\nAs his first act, Jotun shattered the anvil he had used to craft Tyr's hand and reshape his warhammer.\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Seven\n\nFrom the writings of Tyr's Guard, recounting Tyr's death:\n\n\"Loken awakened two of the Old Gods' most powerful generals and sent them after Tyr. These enormous creatures were called the C'Thraxxi. They stormed south and caught up with Tyr and the titan-forged refugees in the land we know as Tirisfal. Or, as the vrykul called it, 'Tyr's Fall.'\n\n\"Tyr stood against the C'Thraxxi alone. It would be his final-and greatest-hour.\n\n\"Tyr called upon all the lessons he had learned in battle. He wielded the Silver Hand as if it were an extension of his own body. The C'Thraxxi slashed at his metal hide, but Tyr's hammer shielded him in holy power and mended his wounds. The battle dragged on, with neither the keeper nor his enemies giving any ground.\n\n\"Tyr knew there was only one way to secure the safety of his allies. He unleashed his immense powers, igniting an explosion of arcane magic that blasted a massive crater in the earth. Tyr and one of his foes were killed instantly. The other, on the verge of death, retreated from the battle site.\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Eight\n\nAfter Tyr's sacrifice, his allies entombed the fallen keeper and the dead C'Thrax where they lay. None of the titan-forged felt worthy of taking up their leader's hammer, and they buried it with his corpse. \n\nTyr's followers then enchanted the tomb with protective wards. They bound the Silver Hand to these magical seals, thereby preventing anyone from touching it in the future.\n\nOf all the titan-forged who had come south, the vrykul were the most moved by what Tyr had done to protect them. They decided to stay in the region and stand vigil over the keeper's tomb.\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Nine\n\nAn excerpt from Legends of the Silver Hand, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"At some point in Azeroth's distant past, humanity emerged in Tirisfal Glades. The iron-skinned vrykul who lived there slowly died off. Many of them suffered from the curse of flesh, a strange malady that transformed them into creatures of flesh and blood.\n\n\"Yet one group of vrykul lasted longer than the others. They formed a secretive group-Tyr's Guard-to protect Keeper Tyr's tomb. The vrykul of this order knew that they would not live forever, and so they inducted some of the fledgling humans into their ranks. \n\n\"The vrykul taught the human members of Tyr's Guard the history of the fallen keeper, his tenets of self-sacrifice and justice, and the truth of what lay within the tomb.\"\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Ten\n\nIn the ancient days, the only humans ever to breach Tyr's tomb and bypass its protectors were following the legendary human king Thoradin. After the elderly ruler abdicated his throne, he became obsessed with his race's history. Thoradin's curiosity eventually led him to discover Tyr's final resting place.\n\nWhen Thoradin arrived at the tomb, Tyr's Guard confronted him. A tense standoff ensued. The former king was accompanied by a powerful retinue of guards and learned sorcerers. Though the members of Tyr's Guard did not want them to disturb the gravesite, they also did not want bloodshed.\n\nThoradin and his followers forced their way past Tyr's Guard. Much of what happened next is shrouded in rumor. It is said that Thoradin and his retinue ventured into the darkened catacombs, and they were never seen again.\n\nTyr's Guard knew that Thoradin's magi had broken the tomb's wards in their foolish quest to explore the gravesite. The order's members made a vow that day-they would not enter the catacombs again, for fear that further meddling could awaken the C'Thrax buried inside and unleash its evil on the world.\n\nThe Silver Hand, Part Eleven\n\nFor thousands of years, Tyr's Guard continued its sacred duty. New members came and went, and over time they adopted more techniques to help them protect Tyr's tomb. In particular, the defenders felt an affinity toward paladins, holy warriors who arose to battle the orcish Horde in the Second War.\n\nThe members of Tyr's Guard learned how to wield the Holy Light, and they became mighty paladins. Yet even this newfound power could not save the order from the undead Scourge.\n\nWhen the Scourge swept over the human kingdom of Lordaeron, Tyr's Guard crumbled. Only a few brave members, led by a paladin named Travard, remained to uphold their ancient vows.\n\nTruthguard\n\nMany have tried to break Truthguard. Vrykul war bringers, mighty giants, and even the wicked minions of the Old Gods. This shield has turned them all aside, and not a scratch mars its gleaming surface.\n\nBut Truthguard is more than just a simple armament. It is the embodiment of justice, nobility, and honor. Bear this shield as you would a torch in the darkness. Bring light to those without hope, and burn away the shadows that seek to engulf your world in death and despair.\n\nTruthguard, Part One\n\nEarthen poems and vrykul epic sagas speak of Truthguard emerging in a time of war, when armies forged of iron marched across the north and made even mountains tremble. \n\nThe main aggressors of this war were the fearsome Winterskorn vrykul. Their goal was to dominate the lands surrounding Ulduar and put all who opposed them to the blade. The Winterskorn were a people who relished violence, and few relished it more than Yrgrim. He stood at the clan's bloody vanguard, leading brutal raids against the good-natured earthen who dwelled in the region.\n\nStrange that someone so obsessed with wanton killing would one day wield Truthguard, a symbol of justice and honor. But the paths that fate weaves are often strange.\n\nTruthguard, Part Two\n\nFrom a set of earthen tablets titled The Winterskorn War:\n\n\"The clang of sword against shield rumbled like thunder through the cavern. The Winterskorn's enchanted blades cleaved through the earthen's stone skin with ease, lopping off limbs and sending heads rolling. \n\n\"When the Winterskorn cornered the few surviving earthen at the back of the cavern, the lead vrykul charged forward with his sword poised to strike. His body came apart before he ever reached his prey.\n\n\"Another Winterskorn had cut him down. He moved quick as lightning then, sword arcing through the rest of his warrior kin.\n\n\"'Follow me and live,' the vrykul said after his killing was done. 'Stay and this place will be your tomb.'\n\n\"Later, the earthen asked this Yrgrim why he had saved them. \n\n\"'The battle lust has lifted from my eyes, and I have seen truth,' Yrgrim replied. 'Killing for the sake of killing... conquering for the sake of conquest... there is no honor in such things. There is only shame and regret.'\"\n\n\nTruthguard, Part Three\n\nYrgrim led the earthen survivors to Keeper Tyr, the one being he believed could save them from the Winterskorn. The vrykul warrior did not expect a reward for doing so. Quite the opposite. Yrgrim had murdered scores of innocent earthen, and he thought Tyr would execute him for his transgressions.\n\nAccording to one vrykul legend, these are the words Tyr spoke to Yrgrim: \"I cannot wash the blood from your hands. No one can. All I can offer you is a way forward. Stand by my side. Hunt the wicked with the same ferocity you once used to hunt the earthen. Do this and you will find the path to redemption.\n\n\"On that day, Yrgrim swore an oath to the twin moons that he would serve Tyr and embody his noble ideals. In return, the keeper gifted the vrykul with a shield unlike any ever made. \n\nIts name was Truthguard.\n\nTruthguard, Part Four\n\nFrom the vrykul saga The Forging of Truthguard:\n\n\"Three strikes it took Keeper Archaedas to shape Truthguard. With the first hammer fall, rivers of magma spilled from the icy mountains. With the second, the sky howled and lightning set the heavens aflame. With the third, a single ray of sunlight pierced the storm clouds and whispered over Truthguard's surface.\n\n\"From afar, Keeper Tyr and the giantess Ironaya watched the work unfold. They had each given of themselves to make Truthguard. Tyr had chiseled off a piece of his silver hand to imbue the shield with righteous power. Ironaya had hewn a stone disc from her hide and etched it with runes of protection.\"\n\nTruthguard, Part Five\n\nTruthguard saw its first battle in the waning days of the Winterskorn War. \n\nWhile searching the frozen wastes for earthen whom he could lead to safety, Yrgrim stumbled across a small raiding party of Winterskorn. The vrykul knew of this \"deserter.\" They cursed Yrgrim's name and howled for his blood. \n\nYrgrim calmly offered a challenge: if any of the vrykul could knock the shield from his grip, he would surrender. But if the Winterskorn failed, they would lay down their arms and listen to Yrgrim's words.\n\nOne after another, the vrykul charged Yrgrim, and their enchanted blades glanced off of Truthguard without making so much as a dent.\n\n\"You fail because you fight for cruelty and injustice,\" Yrgrim said to the bewildered vrykul. \"So long as such wicked thoughts guide your hand, you will never become the champions you hope to be.\" Then he told them of all he had learned from Tyr, of the noble tenets of justice that now governed his life.\n\nAnd one after another, the vrykul joined Yrgrim's cause and cast their enchanted blades aside.\n\n\nTruthguard, Part Six\n\nThe Winterskorn War was only a symptom of a much greater problem: Keeper Loken. He had fallen to darkness and imprisoned many of his fellow keepers within the hallowed halls of Ulduar. But why had he done such terrible things? What could have driven a noble being like Loken to abuse his power?\n\nTruthguard found some of the answers. \n\nAt Tyr's behest, Yrgrim stalked the outskirts of Ulduar with his shield and confronted a small number of Loken's servants. Some were massive fire giants. A few others were iron-skinned vrykul whose only purpose was dealing death. Yrgrim bested them, one and all. When his opponents were on their knees, he forced them to look at their own reflections in Truthguard's surface.\n\nThe shield's righteous power caused the lies and half-truths that clouded their minds to melt away. They saw, for the first time, that Loken had used them as his pawns. Yrgrim's adversaries revealed many details about the fallen keeper, but one was more troubling than the rest...\n\nLoken had succumbed to Yogg-Saron, the malevolent Old God shackled within Ulduar. \n\n\nTruthguard, Part Seven\n\nAn excerpt from an unfinished book on the dwarves' origins, by Royal Historian Archesonus:\n\n\"Tyr vowed to defeat Keeper Loken, but he needed time to plan. He also needed to find a refuge for the innocent earthen, mechagnomes, and vrykul who dwelled around Ulduar. As Tyr led these creatures south in search of a safe haven, he ordered his loyal servant Yrgrim to stay behind. The noble vrykul would hold off any of Loken's minions who tried to prevent the refugees from fleeing.\n\n\"Yrgrim, fabled Truthguard in hand, obeyed his master. It was the last time he would see Tyr alive.\n\n\"Three fire giants soon emerged to hunt down the refugees, but Yrgrim barred their way. They swarmed the lone vrykul and battered Truthguard. Not even the fists of giants could dent the shield.\n\n\"Yrgrim waited until his foes wore themselves ragged against Truthguard, and then he went on the offensive. He slammed the shield against the giants until their molten bodies crumbled and their blood ran like rivers of fire over the land.\"\n\n\nTruthguard, Part Eight\n\nWhile Yrgrim battled the fire giants, Keeper Loken unleashed ancient horrors who had been locked within Ulduar. These were the C'Thraxxi, monstrous servants of the Old Gods. They crawled from their underground chambers and slipped past Yrgrim, eager to exterminate Tyr and his motley followers.\n\nYrgrim sensed the C'Thraxxi's foul presence as they passed by, and he raced south in pursuit of the creatures. By the time he finally caught up to them, it was too late...Tyr had stood against the C'Thraxxi alone, and he had paid the ultimate price to defeat them. His followers would name the site of his valiant sacrifice Tyr's Fall, which in the vrykul tongue translated to \"Tirisfal.\"\n\nTruthguard, Part Nine\n\nYrgrim laid the first stone of the tomb that would serve as Tyr's final resting place. He and his allies labored over the construction in silence, hearts filled with bittersweet reverence. When the work was done, the refugees set off south in search of a safe haven, but Yrgrim did not follow.\n\nHe jammed Truthguard into the earth and swore to stand vigil over his master's tomb. It was the least he could do to honor Tyr's sacrifice. Moved by Yrgrim's decision, the other vrykul joined him.\n\nTruthguard, Part Ten\n\nFor many years, Yrgrim remained in Tirisfal with Truthguard at his side. He urged his allies to dedicate themselves to the pursuit of justice and nobility, just as he had. In this way, Tyr's ideals would live on in more than stories. They would live on through the actions of Yrgrim and the other vrykul.\n\nOnce Yrgrim had taught the Tirisfal vrykul all he could, he departed from the region. His battles had whittled away at his iron hide, and he longed to find a noble champion who could take up Truthguard. \n\nYrgrim's quest eventually led him and his great shield to the land known as Stormheim.\n\nTruthguard, Part Eleven\n\nStormheim was home to many mighty vrykul, and Yrgrim was sure he would find someone capable of bearing Truthguard. He constructed an arena to test the mettle of the local fighters. Challenger after challenger faced off against Yrgrim, but none could meet his high standards.\n\nIn time, no one remained to face Yrgrim's trials. He abandoned his arena, but not his search. He held onto hope that he would find a successor someday.\n\nYrgrim built a vast tomb and locked himself within. There, he waited for a hero. Someone strong of will and pure of heart. Someone worthy of bearing Truthguard, as Tyr would have wanted.\n\nAshbringer\n\nYou now possess one of the most iconic and renowned weapons ever created.\n\nOnce the bane of the undead (then, for a time, one of the Scourge's greatest assets), the Ashbringer has been instrumental in the rise and fall of lords, empires, and kings, living and undead alike. It has stood for both good and evil, and now it rests within your hands. \n\nWield it well.\n\nAshbringer, Part One\n\nFew known artifacts or relics are capable of rivaling the Ashbringer's legendary pedigree. \n\nIts origins have been traced to the Second War between orcs and humans. There, on the field of battle, the renowned highlord Alexandros Mograine came into possession of a dark orb. \n\nThough Alexandros considered the artifact to be a living embodiment of shadow, he also believed that it might one day be forged into a weapon of righteousness. \n\nAlexandros's vision would become a reality, and that weapon would become the Ashbringer.\n\nAshbringer, Part Two\n\nIt is said that deep within the hallowed halls of Ironforge, the Ashbringer was crafted by the dwarf king Magni Bronzebeard, a peerless weaponsmith. \n\nFor King Magni, it was a dark time; he grieved over the recent loss of his brother Muradin.\n\nLegend holds that King Magni infused the full weight of his rage and sorrow into the Ashbringer's forging, resulting in a weapon of untold vengeance and devastation.\n\nAshbringer, Part Three\n\nSo it is written, that when confronted by undead forces, Highlord Alexandros Mograine dispatched them with ease. The blade in his hand felt like an extension of his own flesh, a beautifully lethal instrument of pure destruction.\n\nAnd as it carved a swath through his Scourge enemies, this new weapon left naught in the aftermath but charred bone and swirling ash.\n\nThus was the Ashbringer given its name.\n\nAshbringer, Part Four\n\nIn the hands of Alexandros Mograine, the Ashbringer rained unparalleled fury upon the marauding Scourge armies, decimating the undead in numbers beyond reckoning. \n\nSo it was that over the course of time, the man and the weapon seemed as one. Ashbringer became a name of legend, attributed not just to the fearsome blade but also to the relentless knight who wielded it.\n\nAshbringer, Part Five\n\nFrom the testimony of Fairbanks, advisor to Highlord Alexandros Mograine, shortly before his execution:\n\n\"It was outside of Stratholme that we were surrounded by undead. Their numbers were unfathomable. Wave after wave washed over us... and yet Alexandros stood tall, unbowed and unbroken, a rock for them to break against.\n\n\"Alexandros's end came not from the undead but from his own son-the treacherous one, Renault, who took up the Ashbringer and stabbed his father in the back.\"\n\nAshbringer, Part Six\n\nA recounting of the battle at Naxxramas by Darion Mograine, as told to Atticus Krohl:\n\n\"Deep within the floating undead citadel of Naxxramas, I discovered what had truly become of my father. Alexandros's spirit had been tortured and broken; he had been raised as a death knight to defend the very Scourge that he had once labored to destroy. \n\n\"They had scoured from him all that was good, leaving behind only a bitter, rotten shell. In defense of my own life, I was forced to end his cursed existence, or so I thought. \n\n\"The blade you see, the Ashbringer... it spoke to me in my father's voice.\"\n\nAshbringer, Part Seven\n\nFrom the Liber Monasterium:\n\n\"And so it was that Darion Mograine, driven by the voice of his father, bore the Ashbringer to the Scarlet Monastery, where he learned of his brother Renault's treachery.\n\n\"The vengeful phantom of Alexandros Mograine manifested out of the Ashbringer. Renault begged for forgiveness, and he was dealt a vicious sweep of the corrupted blade, separating his head from his shoulders. \n\n\"'You are forgiven,' was Alexandros's reply.\"\n\nAshbringer, Part Eight\n\nAn excerpt from The Battle for Light's Hope:\n\n\"The Argent Dawn amassed at Light's Hope Chapel against the swarming multitudes of Scourge. Battle was joined, and though each and every one of us fought bravely, it seemed there could be no hope of victory.\n\n\"In our darkest hour, in an effort to free his father's condemned soul, Darion Mograine plunged the Ashbringer into his own chest. \n\n\"It was then that the souls of the myriad champions buried beneath Light's Hope lashed out in a devastating blast of purest Light. In that instant, our enemies were undone.\"\n\nAshbringer, Part Nine\n\nThere are scores of firsthand accounts of the Second Battle for Light's Hope Chapel. They differ in some ways, but on many points, they correspond. What is known is that several years after his sacrifice at the first Battle for Light's Hope, Darion Mograine returned... this time as would-be conqueror, a death knight in the Lich King's service.\n\nHe faced off against his onetime ally, a former Knight of the Silver Hand, Tirion Fordring. Ultimately Darion was subdued even as the dreaded Lich King himself, Arthas, appeared on the battlefield. \n\nIn an apparent act of contrition, Darion threw the Ashbringer to Tirion, who purified it with his touch. Tirion then focused his full efforts on the Lich King, who was forced to retreat after a single mighty blow from the uncorrupted Ashbringer.\n\nAshbringer, Part Ten\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second Battle for Light's Hope, the Ashbringer remained in the possession of Tirion Fordring, highlord of the Argent Crusade. In order to draw out the greatest champions of Azeroth, Tirion instituted a contest of strength and battle prowess known as the Argent Tournament.\n\nIn time, Tirion's Argent Crusade successfully breached the main gate of the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown Citadel. As they laid siege to Icecrown's defenses, the highlord created a pact with Darion Mograine and his Knights of the Ebon Blade, resulting in the Ashen Verdict-a united order bent on destroying the Lich King.\n\nAshbringer, Part Eleven\n\nThe final assault on Icecrown Citadel now ranks among the most legendary military campaigns in recent memory.\n\nMarching alongside some of the greatest champions of Azeroth, Tirion Fordring continued his crusade against the Scourge, staging an all-out attack on the Lich King's seat of power. \n\nThere, Tirion once again confronted Arthas, and all fell silent as the clash of steel rang out across the icy wastes. At the culmination of a fevered battle, the Ashbringer shattered Arthas's infamous sword, Frostmourne, in a single blow. \n\nArthas was defeated at last, and the purified Ashbringer took its place among the most celebrated and renowned weapons in all of Azeroth's history.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on!

What free folk lived there rallied as best they could, strong and defiant to the end. They would not give up their land for this Thunder King.\n\nBut Lei Shen was not there for the land, he had come for its people. His empire was growing, and slaves were required for the building of its cities and fortresses.\n\nSo rather than attack the summit, Lei Shen boomed with his mighty voice: \"Choose the greatest warrior among you and have him face me in one on one combat. Should I win, your people will submit to my rule. Should he win, I shall leave these lands in peace.\"\n\n\"Challenge accepted!\" came a voice that boomed across the mountains almost as strong as the thunderous presence of Lei Shen.\n\nFrom the mountains descended Xuen, the White Tiger. The August Celestial had seen the plight of the free peoples and could bear it no more.\n\nAnd so began the duel of legends. Lightning fell from the skies and the ground rumbled with the fury of these two fighters. Sorcery was matched with speed, hate was matched with strength. \n\nIt is said this duel lasted for thirty days and thirty nights, and the emotions of this duel awoke the sha in great force.\n\nBut in the end, Xuen fell, crushed by the sheer might of Lei Shen's unearthly power. \n\n\"Your peasant magic is no match for my sorcery, fool of a tiger,\" Lei Shen bellowed. \"I commend your tenacity, but your defiance must be punished.\"\n\nAnd to the people of Kun-Lai, the Thunder King proclaimed: \"Know this, those who would defy me shall witness the full power of my wrath! This creature shall not know the mercy of death. In these mountains we shall build a prison for him to stand upon for all of time. From this pinnacle, he shall watch and bask in his failure, as you and your children shall serve my empire as slaves.\"\n\nAnd so Xuen was placed at the pinnacle of Kun-Lai Summit and made to watch as the pandaren and hozen were made slaves.

With this blade, a visionary warlord named Thoradin united his race into a single nation. He led his people to victory against the trolls in one of the greatest wars humankind has ever fought. He changed the destiny of the world. Strom'kar's story is one of violence and bloodshed, of cunning and desperation. And, ultimately, of bravery and sacrifice.\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part One\n\nThe early human tribes had many legends about giants who had once walked among them. These mighty beings had many names, but the most common attributed to them was \"vrykul.\" The folktales said that the giants watched over humans as parents would watch over sons and daughters. The vrykul taught their primitive children the ways of foraging, of masonry and smithing, and of making war.\n\nBy the time of Warlord Thoradin, the vrykul of the human lands had long since died out. What little remained of their presence included weapons they had left behind. The humans treated these arms as sacred heirlooms and symbols of their tribes. But the blade later known as Strom'kar would become much more than that. \n\nIn Thoradin's hands, it would become a symbol of all humanity.\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Two\n\nFrom chapter eight of The One True Human Kingdom, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Even as the brutish Amani trolls raided and pillaged, the human tribes bickered and squabbled with each other. Only Warlord Thoradin and his Arathi tribe recognized the folly of their ways. If they did not unite, the moss-skinned trolls would crush humankind and desecrate its ancestral lands.\n\n\"So it was that Thoradin declared himself king and set out to bring the tribes to heel. Many he won to his side through the marriages of his sons and daughters. Others, through promises of wealth and land. \n\n\"But some closed their ears to words of diplomacy. They spoke only the language of violence.\n\n\"Fortunately, Thoradin knew that language well.\"\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Three\n\nFor weeks, Thoradin and his warriors struggled to conquer the rugged mountain people known as the Alteraci. Though the upstart king was confident he could subdue the tribe if given enough time, he knew the cost would be very high. To prevent unnecessary bloodshed, he changed his tactics. \n\nThoradin shed his battle armor and painted his chest with Arathi tribal symbols. With only Strom'kar in hand, he marched up the mountain and challenged the Alteraci leader, Ignaeus, to a duel.\n\nBefore long, Ignaeus emerged from the forest, skin dyed red with his own tribal marks, blade sharpened and hungry for death. He dwarfed Thoradin in size and strength, but the Arathi leader had other advantages. He had chosen the duel on a day when thick fog enveloped the mountains. Using the weather to his advantage, Thoradin eluded Ignaeus's wild swings and disarmed his bigger foe.\n\nIgnaeus was at Thoradin's mercy, but the Arathi leader did not strike. He plunged Strom'kar into the damp earth and extended the hand of peace. On that day, he won the Alteraci to his side.\n\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Four\n\nThe only human tribe powerful enough to end King Thoradin's dream of unity dwelled in Tirisfal Glades. A great warrior named Lordain led the region's noble people. They would not submit to shows of force like the Alteraci. To win their loyalty, Thoradin needed to appeal to their religious beliefs.\n\nThus Thoradin and his personal guards made a pilgrimage to the region's shrines and sacred groves. At each site, the king performed rituals as was the custom of Lordain and his kin. Thoradin even wore a pendant of the silver hand, an image held sacred by Tirisfal's humans.\n\nAt the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin met with Lordain. The king pledged that if the tribe joined him, he would adopt their mystic ways and spread them among the Arathi. To seal his promise, Thoradin ran his palm along Strom'kar's edge and mixed his blood with the earth of Tirisfal.\n\nThe histories record Thoradin as saying, \"Between our people, let this be the only blood we spill.\"\n\nAnd so it was. Lordain and his people bent the knee to King Thoradin.\n\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Five\n\nFrom chapter fourteen of The One True Human Kingdom, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Thoradin and other early human warlords held their swords and axes sacred. Many believed that the spirits of their ancestors lived on in their weapons. With this in mind, it's quite extraordinary that Thoradin convinced all of the human tribal leaders to lend him their personal blades. \n\n\"Arathi blacksmiths took shards of metal from each of these weapons and added them to Thoradin's greatsword. It was an act of brilliance, for it secured the eternal loyalty of the tribes. Who would ever rise up against Thoradin and risk striking the sword that contained their own ancestors?\n\n\"When the work was done, Thoradin renamed his sword Strom'kar, the Warbreaker.\"\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Six\n\nWith the human tribes united, King Thoradin set out to found a new capital. According to one legend, he discovered his answer in a dream. In it, he saw his father wearing the pelt of a black wolf. He told Thoradin of an arid land southeast of Tirisfal Glades. If the king built his capital there, his people would prosper.\n\nThoradin sought out the land from his dream, a region known today as the Arathi Highlands. As the story goes, the king spied a black wolf roaming the barren terrain. On that spot, Thoradin used Strom'kar to carve out the boundaries of his city in the dirt. Then he set his masons to work.\n\nSo arose Strom, mighty capital of the first human kingdom.\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Seven\n\nThoradin was not a king to sit idle on his throne, just as Strom'kar was not a sword to sit idle in its sheath.\n\nThe Arathi military patrolled the far-flung borders of the human territories, repelling Amani troll incursions. King Thoradin took part in many of these skirmishes, often at great risk to his own life. \n\nOne account tells of a brutal Amani ambush that struck Thoradin's forces. The trolls routed the humans, separating the king from his warriors. Though he was outnumbered ten to one, Thoradin did not flee. He did not beg. He did not cower. No true Arathi would stain his honor with such craven acts.\n\nThoradin sharpened Strom'kar's edge on the skulls of his enemies and painted its steel with their blood. When the guards finally reached him, they found their king standing over ten broken Amani corpses.\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Eight\n\nFrom chapter twenty-nine of The Warring Tribes and the Rise of Arathor, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"To defeat the Amani, Arathor and the high elves of Quel'Thalas forged an alliance. King Thoradin marshaled over twenty thousand human soldiers and launched his armies at the trolls. The decisive battle unfolded at Alterac Fortress. The Amani host besieged the stronghold. While the humans defended the fortress from the onslaught, the high elves smashed into the troll rearguard. \n\n\"Thoradin waded through the Amani warbands with the rest of his soldiers, Strom'kar hacking down troll after troll. Once the king knew his forces had worn the enemy thin, he revealed his secret weapon.\n\n\"One hundred human magi emerged from Alterac Fortress. Alongside elven sorcerers, they pooled their power and unleashed a single terrible spell on the Amani. A column of fire ripped down from the heavens and blasted through the trolls. The howling torrent of flame burned the Amani to ash. \n\n\"Thus the Troll Wars ended, with human and elf triumphant.\"\n\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Nine\n\nAfter the Troll Wars, Thoradin embarked on a diplomatic mission to Quel'Thalas and secured humanity's bond of loyalty with the high elves. The king created a military pact so that each side would help the other if the Amani ever threatened their lands again. He also carved out new territorial borders with the elves and drew up trade agreements to foster the prosperity of Arathor for generations to come.\n\nBefore Thoradin left Quel'Thalas, the elves gave him a gift. Their greatest blacksmiths and enchanters toiled over Strom'kar and imbued it with extraordinary power. Thoradin marveled at the masterwork of the elves. The new Strom'kar gleamed with an otherworldly beauty. It weighed almost nothing in Thoradin's hands, and no matter how often he used it, the edge never seemed to dull.\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Ten\n\nAs his years wore on, a grizzled Thoradin abdicated his throne in peace. He broke tradition and kept Strom'kar as his own. Though some bristled at what they considered an act of greed, Thoradin retained the blade for practical reasons. Strom'kar had become a symbol of kingship. Thoradin wanted Arathor's citizenry to see his bloodline as the legitimate rulers, not simply whoever wielded the sword.\n\nFree from the burden of leadership, Thoradin spent much of his time studying ancient ruins in Tirisfal Glades. He became obsessed with the origins of humankind and with the tales of giants who once walked the land. Thoradin learned to use Strom'kar's enchantments to locate hidden places of power.\n\nDuring one of his journeys in Tirisfal, Thoradin and a retinue of his followers entered mysterious catacombs buried beneath the earth. According to the legends, none of them were ever seen again.\n\n\nStrom'kar, the Warbreaker, Part Eleven\n\nMany strange tales exist about what befell Thoradin, but the truth is the strangest of them all. In Tirisfal Glades, he discovered two long-lost subterranean chambers. One belonged to the noble keeper Tyr. The other, to a monstrosity known as Zakajz, a bloodthirsty servant of the malevolent Old Gods.\n\nBefore written history, Tyr had sacrificed himself to defeat Zakajz in a battle that shook the heart of Azeroth. The keeper's allies buried both combatants at the site of their mythic confrontation, and they sealed the tomb with magical wards to prevent anyone from disturbing what lay inside.\n\nUnaware of the great darkness locked beneath the earth, Thoradin instructed the magi in his retinue to break the seals. They succeeded... and, in so doing, their arcane spellwork inadvertently resurrected Zakajz. As the lumbering creature tore through Thoradin's followers, the former king did not flee. He did not beg. He did not cower. No true Arathi would stain his honor with such craven acts.\n\nThoradin sharpened Strom'kar's edge one last time, burying the sword into Zakajz's skull. The blade's elven enchantments forced the horror into a deep slumber and prevented it from regenerating.\n\nIt was Thoradin's last great act. At the moment of his strike, he suffered a mortal wound from Zakajz. The warrior who united humankind died that day, Strom'kar stained with the blood of one final enemy.\n\n\nOdyn's Fury, Helya's Wrath, Warswords of the Valarjar\n\nKeeper Odyn believed the natural creatures of this world were too weak, too soft, and too short-lived to be trusted. You have already shown him his folly, and none of us has any doubt that you will continue to do so.\n\nNow you will carry Odyn's prized weapons in defense of Azeroth. Go forth and forge your legacy.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part One\n\nKeeper Odyn was inspired to create an army of titan-forged champions, the Valarjar, and set them to protect Azeroth against the multitude of threats he knew it would face. But his dream was thwarted, and his Valarjar were contained for thousands of years.\n\nBefore Odyn was imprisoned, he crafted two blades. They were meant to aid the greatest among the Valarjar. \n\nInstead, they fell into the hands of his enemies.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Two\n\nIn ancient days, Odyn oversaw the creation of the Halls of Valor, a sanctuary for the spirits of the mightiest vrykul who had given their lives in glorious battle. He had led the armies of the Pantheon against the Old Gods, and he knew there would always be a need for brave, fearless champions to face the forces of evil.\n\nThe most talented blacksmiths among the vrykul were asked to create weapons and armor for these peerless warriors. Keeper Odyn was awed by the work of one smith; his shields were light and strong, truly astonishing in the hands of a skilled fighter.\n\nOdyn asked him to try something new. \"Focus not only on mere defense,\" the keeper said, \"but also on the poetry of aggression.\"\n\nThe smith heeded Odyn's words and soon presented the keeper with two of the finest warswords ever made on a vrykul forge. Odyn did not merely accept them; he blessed them with his power.\n\nOdyn hung these warswords in the Halls of Valor and let them motivate the Valarjar, his champions. \"These will be carried into battle by only the greatest among you,\" Odyn said. \"So go, then. Prove yourself worthy.\"\n\nIt would be many years before someone rose to the challenge.\n\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Three\n\nThe first-and-only Valarjar to carry these weapons into battle was named Ingvar. He was a renowned fighter when he was alive, and a legendary warrior after his death. \n\nAlways aggressive, Ingvar led a raiding party to investigate a cave that seemed to be dripping with dark magic. Inside they found something terrible: a pack of creatures that had been corrupted by the Old Gods. When the Old Gods' war against the titan-forged had been all but lost, C'Thun quietly lashed out worldwide, seizing the minds of whatever the entity could touch.\n\nIngvar and his comrades were frighteningly outnumbered. But they did not run. Most of the vrykul fell in minutes, but Ingvar remained standing. Though badly wounded, he fought his way through the cave and destroyed every enemy inside. \n\nAfter his last breath, the Val'kyr Helya sent his spirit to the Halls of Valor, where Odyn welcomed him with open arms.\n\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Four\n\nIngvar's death had been a noble sacrifice that resulted in victory against incredible odds. Keeper Odyn declared him a paragon among the Valarjar and bestowed upon him these warswords. In times of great peril, Ingvar was always the first to lead the Valarjar into the fray.\n\nBut all too soon, his acts of heroism came to an end. \n\nWhen Odyn had set out to realize his vision for the Halls of Valor and the Valarjar, he had needed to create Val'kyr, spirits capable of preserving worthy souls for all time. Helya had not been interested in becoming a Val'kyr. No one had volunteered, in fact. Odyn had transformed her and others into Val'kyr against their will.\n\nFor many years, Helya had no chance to seek vengeance. When the opportunity arose, she took it without hesitation.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Five\n\nKeeper Loken had fallen under the sway of madness, but he was clever. He knew Odyn and his Valarjar would be formidable enemies, so he approached Helya with a proposition. He would break Odyn's control over her; in exchange, she would trap Odyn and his champions within the Halls of Valor.\n\nHelya's anger burned deep within her, and she accepted. The plan worked almost flawlessly. Odyn was entirely unprepared for Helya's rebellion, and he and nearly all his Valarjar were neutralized, confined to their sanctuary in the sky.\n\nOnly a few Valarjar were outside of the Halls of Valor when Helya attacked. One of them was Ingvar.\n\nHe took these warswords and immediately retaliated, hoping to defeat Helya and free Odyn.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Six\n\nAs a Val'kyr, Helya had tremendous control over the spirits of the deceased. Champion or not, Ingvar understood that he was facing a fight he likely would not win.\n\nBut he had these warswords, imbued with Odyn's power. There was no one else to make the attempt.\n\nIngvar found Helya and tried to strike her down. In his hands, these swords nearly overwhelmed her. But in the end, she overpowered his spirit and smote him into oblivion. His swords fell to Azeroth, among the few Valarjar artifacts that were not trapped within the Halls of Valor.\n\nHelya kept them as a memento of her victory over Keeper Odyn.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Seven\n\nOver several millennia, Helya claimed as many souls of slain vrykul as she could, and her ranks of Kvaldir--corrupted, undead vrykul--continued to swell.\n\nHelya began to go after the souls of not just the heroic vrykul dead but also the living. Any vrykul who seemed poised to learn the truth about the conflict between Helya and Odyn became a target, and she had her Kvaldir slay them with ruthless efficiency. \n\nShe started to raise her own champions, the Helarjar of Helheim, and she had them search Azeroth for her enemies.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Eight\n\nAny spirits that ended up in Helya's care suffered greatly. Helheim was torment for vrykul heroes, who found themselves transformed into Kvaldir even if they had been worthy of entering the Halls of Valor as Valarjar.\n\nMany of these vrykul became more dangerous in death than they had been in life. Empowered by Helya and afraid of disappointing her, they zealously obeyed her commands. \n\nEventually, one of these Kvaldir caught Helya's attention. Vigfus Bladewind distinguished himself in battle against vrykul, and Helya decided that he was worthy to bear these swords for all time.\n\nWhat better way to end the lives of Odyn's faithful than with two of his prized creations?\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Nine\n\nVigfus Bladewind used these swords to kill many vrykul heroes over the years. Helya even committed some of her own power into the blades, just as Odyn had. Not only did their lethal potential increase, but they made it easier for Helya to claim their victims' souls.\n\nIn truth, it is her power that makes these weapons truly magnificent. Her power, laced with her hatred, crashes endlessly against Odyn's spirit. The tension between those energies will forever permeate these blades, threatening to overwhelm whoever carries them into battle. A single lapse in the heat of combat could result in oblivion.\n\nNever forget that.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Ten\n\nHelya's champion, Vigfus Bladewind, carried these weapons for millennia, spilling untold amounts of heroic blood.\n\nOn occasion, Helya would test him to see if he was still truly worthy of her favor. She would give him unwinnable fights. Sometimes she would make him battle other exceptional Kvaldir, or she would order him to raid vrykul settlements without any help. \n\nWith these weapons in hand, he never failed.\n\nWarswords of the Valarjar, Part Eleven\n\nIn the moments before Bladewind's destruction, he asked Helya for aid. She granted it to him, pouring even more of her spirit into these weapons. A measure of that extra power remains, and it will for all eternity.\n\nThese weapons were forged to assist mighty warriors who fight without fear. They turn bloodlust into power, and only one with an indomitable will can hope to control them. If they are ever wielded against Azeroth again, the world may not survive.\n\nIf they are used to defend it, the world may never fall.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder\n\nThese magnificent artifacts were forged from a scale of the Earth-Warder, Neltharion. As you might imagine, obtaining it came at a high cost.\n\nThis sword and shield have endured countless battles, wielded by a legendary vrykul warrior and king. Thanks to your help, his spirit can rest in peace, but his armaments now pass to you. May they bring you the same victories they brought him.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part One\n\nWhen Odyn created the Halls of Valor, countless vrykul sought to prove themselves worthy of joining the ranks of his mighty valarjar. Perhaps none went to such lengths as the one who would become king: Magnar Icebreaker. His victories in battle were beyond measure, and the strength of his deeds inspired others to seek their own heroic legacy.\n\nMany of his greatest deeds were accomplished with two legendary artifacts: the Scale of the Earth-Warder and the Scaleshard. Obtaining them nearly cost Magnar his life, but their power carried him to heights even he never imagined were within reach.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Two\n\nMagnar's comrades gave him the name \"Icebreaker\" after his successful campaign in Northrend. While hunting nests of nerubians, Magnar discovered a way to surprise the enemy. Cracks in glacier walls could be turned into tunnels, allowing him to dig deep into enemy strongholds and assault them from within.\n\nAs he traveled across Azeroth, Magnar saw many powerful creatures, but none enraptured him so much as Neltharion, the Dragon Aspect of Earth. Vrykul and dragons rarely had reason to interact, but over the years, Magnar never failed to watch in awe when Neltharion flew overhead. With Neltharion's lair close to the vrykul home of Stormheim, Magnar began to wonder what might be waiting inside. What marvels would the Earth-Warder's den hold? What power could the vrykul obtain?\n\nHis curiosity would become an obsession.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Three\n\nMagnar Icebreaker convinced a raiding party of vrykul warriors to accompany him into Neltharion's lair. They waited until they saw the Dragon Aspect leave his mountain, and then they carefully crept inside. They hoped they would find treasure or artifacts; what they found instead was a host of enemies.\n\nThough Neltharion was gone, many of his kin remained. A colossal fight broke out in the smaller side caverns beneath Highmountain, pitting the vrykul invaders against impossible odds. Magnar led his party in a frantic run for an exit, but before they could escape, Neltharion returned to his lair.\n\nThe Dragon Aspect, enraged at the trespassers, unleashed a single lethal breath of fire. There was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run. In desperation, Magnar grabbed a piece of debris from the ground--it was one of Neltharion's cast-off scales. It saved Magnar's life. The blast of flame parted around the black scale, but the sheer force carried Magnar out of the lair, sending him tumbling down the slopes of Highmountain.\n\nMagnar was badly wounded, but he survived.\n\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Four\n\nA black dragon's wrath was not easily shrugged away. It took years for Magnar to recover from his injuries.\n\nHe spent the time examining the scale he had taken from Neltharion's lair. He was in awe of its resiliency. It had saved him from a fiery death without being so much as scratched or singed. Magnar wanted the scale to be forged into a lasting armament, but no vrykul blacksmith knew how to sculpt something so unusual. \n\nAs Magnar recuperated, he began to study the art of blacksmithing. If nobody else knew how to unlock the scale's potential, he would learn to do it himself.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Five\n\nFew understood Magnar's motivations. Most vrykul sought a place in the Halls of Valor through glory on the battlefield, not by working a blacksmith's forge. In time, Magnar would become known as a respectable smith in his own right. The edges of his blades were often sharper and more precise than those of his peers. \n\nThey needed to be. Magnar knew he would only have one opportunity to craft Neltharion's scale into a worthy shield.\n\nWhen the time came, Magnar retreated to his forge and began to work. Days later, he emerged. In his grasp were two armaments unlike any the vrykul had ever seen. One was a shield of unimaginable endurance. The other was a sword, polished to a fine edge. It was the last time Magnar created a weapon. \n\nHe would never need another.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Six\n\nMagnar was already a respected warrior. With his new sword and shield in his hands, he became a legend. Tempered by his disastrous venture into Highmountain, he approached his campaigns with thoughtfulness and discipline, and against his newly forged power, the enemies of the vrykul stood little chance.\n\nOther vrykul flocked to his side with each victory, believing that Magnar's astonishing feats would usher them all into the Halls of Valor as Valarjar, immortal champions. \n\nBefore long, Magnar was leading a sizeable portion of the vrykul people. Only a few years after forging his armaments, he was known as King Magnar Icebreaker.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Seven\n\nMagnar Icebreaker eventually returned his sights to the region where he had made his name: Northrend. Remnants of the insectoid nerubian armies were once again emerging from their caves, seeking to seize Ulduar and the titan machinery within it.\n\nAgainst Magnar, they did not get far. The king led his people against the nerubians, pushing them back to the entrance of Azjol-Nerub itself. So thorough was the nerubians' defeat that they ceased all aggression for millennia.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Eight\n\nNo vrykul doubted that Magnar would ascend to the Halls of Valor upon his death. And even though Helya had sealed away Keeper Odyn and the Valarjar, she wondered if Magnar's spirit would be strong enough to make the journey anyway.\n\nKing Magnar Icebreaker had his sights focused firmly on the city of Stormheim, now occupied by Highborne elves. The vrykul believed that their path to a glorious afterlife with Odyn would be cleared if they once again held their ancestral home. \n\nHelya and her followers knew this ambition would provide their best opportunity to bring down Magnar... and with luck, his soul would be dragged to Helheim, not the Halls of Valor.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Nine\n\nThe vrykul launched a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the Highborne with their ferocity. For weeks the two sides skirmished. Magnar led the charge. The Scale of the Earth-Warder protected him from the elves' arcane reprisals, and the vrykul's assault scored immediate victories, building enough momentum to push the Highborne out of the city entirely.\n\nThe elves' last chance to reclaim the city happened at Nightborne Pass. The Highborne rallied their forces for a final counterattack, clashing with the vrykul in a brutal, confined brawl.\n\nIn the end, the vrykul stood victorious. The Highborne were forced to flee for their lives. They never made a claim upon Stormheim again.\n\nBut it was then, at the moment of Magnar's biggest triumph, that betrayal fell upon him.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Ten\n\nMere moments after the vrykul secured their victory over the Highborne, the servants of Helya struck. Traitors arose within the vrykul's ranks to slaughter Magnar's closest confidants... and his son, Hruthnir. Amid the chaos, more of Helya's followers, the Helarjar, arrived to make sure Magnar was killed.\n\nAfter seeing his son butchered, Magnar was consumed with rage. He became a whirlwind of death, killing every enemy within reach. Countless Kvaldir and traitorous vrykul had fallen to his blade before, finally, they brought him down. His people were able to rally and prevent the Helarjar from claiming Stormheim, but they were too late to save their king.\n\nScale of the Earth-Warder, Part Eleven\n\nIn death, Magnar's spirit lingered. His rage stopped him from making the journey to the Halls of Valor... but it also kept his soul from Helya's grasp. \n\nFor thousands upon thousands of years, he burned with righteous fury, hovering between the life long past and the afterlife he deserved. But now he is free, reunited with his son in the presence of Odyn. \n\nHis armaments remain on Azeroth, destined to bring glory and honor to whoever wields them next.\n\nNote from Fjornson\n\nThere is more to tell of these legends.

We knew him well... but do not mourn him. His death was far too swift and merciful for a traitor who spilled so much Illidari blood.\n\nThese weapons of his are truly dangerous, infused with the essence of his eredar master, Kil'jaeden. They will try to make you the Deceiver's new puppet. Do not give in to weakness as Varedis did.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part One\n\nThese weapons were owned by Varedis Felsoul. He was an Illidari, one of the finest demon hunters ever to join our ranks.\n\nAnd then he betrayed us all. The power in these weapons was Varedis's reward for turning on his brothers and sisters and joining the army he had once sworn to defeat. We cannot change what he did. But we can avenge every drop of blood that he spilled on the Legion's behalf, and with these warglaives, we can return the favor a thousand times over.\n\nWith a little luck, these weapons will one day be turned against Varedis's master.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Two\n\nLet us not forget what Varedis Felsoul accomplished. He was among the first five blood elves sent by the crown prince Kael'thas Sunstrider to train with Lord Illidan Stormrage as demon hunters. It was a brutal affair. Three of those elves died in training, and a fourth was lost to madness.\n\nOnly Varedis survived. The hunger to kill demons was strong within him, too strong to let him fall before he had tasted the Legion's blood. He sacrificed his eyes with a smile and without even flinching at the pain.\n\nHe was-he seemed to be-one of the most dedicated souls ever to challenge the Burning Legion.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Three\n\nOnce Varedis had earned his place among the Illidari, his training continued. It was a trial by fire. Inexperienced demon hunters did not have the luxury of studying for years in libraries or classrooms before entering combat. Fresh recruits were sent out on dangerous missions, accompanied by experienced mentors.\n\nVaredis trained with three of Illidan's best fighters. Time and time again, his blades joined theirs in spilling demonic blood across the cosmos.\n\nWithin a year, Varedis had surpassed his mentors and was helping other recruits survive their first contacts with the Legion. He had become truly effective, occasionally accompanying Lord Illidan himself on his most important journeys.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Four\n\nVaredis's most fateful mission was a solo task. On Outland, Lord Illidan had heard too many reports that the remnants of the Shadow Council were active. Varedis was dispatched to scout for--and steal--any information he could find.\n\nLittle blood was spilled that day. Varedis snuck into a cave complex inhabited by Shadow Council acolytes without drawing attention to himself. He found something odd, a book that radiated with demonic essence. Inside was priceless information about the nature of demons, their weaknesses, and their habits. This tome, the Book of Fel Names, contained within it tremendous power.\n\nAnd it was impossible to remove. The Shadow Council had enchanted it in ways that stopped Varedis from taking it from the cave.\n\nThinking quickly, Varedis simply imbibed as much of the book's power as he could. He left it in place, and the Shadow Council had no idea an Illidari had even been there.\n\nLord Illidan praised him for his achievement. After all, using the demons' own power against them was the central purpose of a demon hunter. Varedis's pride swelled.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Five\n\nVaredis enjoyed his heightened power for years, using it to become a stinging thorn in the Burning Legion's side. He could sense the movement of demons before he saw it happen; he understood what they were thinking before they acted.\n\nBut Varedis did not know that he had not stolen the book's power. He had simply become linked to it.\n\nWhen the Burning Legion invaded Outland, chaos erupted. Illidan put his final plans into effect and called upon all Illidari to help him.\n\nChampions of the Horde and the Alliance stormed through the Dark Portal to stave off the Burning Legion's assault. They confronted members of the Shadow Council and stole the Book of Fel Names, breaking the enchantments that had held it in place.\n\nThis would prove to be Varedis's downfall.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Six\n\nNeither the Horde nor the Alliance understood Illidan's plans. They believed him to be an ally of the Legion. Acting upon this belief, they laid siege to the Black Temple. Many Illidari tried to stand in their way. Varedis was one of them.\n\nBut he was confronted by powerful enemies who possessed the Book of Fel Names. They began to destroy the book, page by page, and Varedis was stunned to realize that the book's destruction was weakening him. His borrowed demonic power faded quickly.\n\nVaredis died in the Black Temple. His soul, imbued with demonic energy, did not rest easily in oblivion. It was whisked away to the Twisting Nether.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Seven\n\nIt is a risk all demon hunters face. By stealing the demons' power, our souls may return to their domain--and their control--after we fall in battle.\n\nThis was Varedis Felsoul's fate. Kil'jaeden himself claimed his soul and heaped endless torment upon him.\n\nVaredis resisted for a time. It was not the pain that broke his spirit. Kil'jaeden is called the Deceiver for a reason, after all. The eredar lord played upon his shock from that battle in the Black Temple. Champions had been prepared to face Varedis; who had told them about his borrowed power?\n\nIt had not been demons, certainly. The Legion would have preferred to have the Book of Fel Names back intact. It had not been the Shadow Council, for the same reason. \"It must have been the Illidari,\" Kil'jaeden told him. \"Only they knew of your power. They betrayed you.\"\n\nVaredis would come to believe him.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Eight\n\nOnce Kil'jaeden had poisoned Varedis's mind, he began to tempt the fallen Illidari. The demon hunter had only tasted the Legion's true power. Should Varedis pledge himself to the Burning Legion, he would receive the full measure.\n\nVaredis agreed, breaking every one of his oaths and betraying every one of his comrades.\n\nKil'jaeden had special plans for him. With the help of other eredar, Kil'jaeden conducted a dangerous, agonizing ritual, infusing a small part of his soul into Varedis's spirit. When the ritual was complete, Varedis was not a demon hunter but a demon, loyal to the Burning Legion and hungry for vengeance.\n\nVaredis found that his weapons, these warglaives, had also been changed. The ritual had imbued them with another slice of Kil'jaeden's astonishing power.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Nine\n\nIn the years after Varedis's conversion, he became a terror to all who might oppose the Burning Legion. World after world, city after city, innocent after innocent, he was sent to spill blood.\n\nOften he worked quietly. Secretly. The Burning Legion did not want any on Azeroth to know his true potential.\n\nBut the Legion did allow him some satisfaction from time to time. Those few among the Illidari who had escaped after Illidan's death had fled to the corners of Outland and Azeroth. Varedis was dispatched to hunt them down, one by one. It was a task he relished. They had betrayed him, in his mind.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Ten\n\nFor a long time, we Illidari did not know who was hunting us. It was not until the Legion's arrival on the Broken Isles that he finally revealed himself.\n\nWhen the Vault of the Wardens was raided, a shadow was seen in the sky. Someone swooped down again and again, slaughtering the newly freed Illidari who were trying to escape. That was Varedis Felsoul. He could not resist the opportunity to butcher so many of us.\n\nHe likely had a tactical reason for doing so. His actions alerted us to his presence. He knew somebody would come for him, one of the strongest among the Illidari, and he believed he could set a trap to kill them.\n\nPerhaps he regretted that decision in his last moments.\n\nTwinblades of the Deceiver, Part Eleven\n\nLet Varedis's story be a warning. He was dedicated, he was powerful, he was clever, and he was effective... and yet his will could not survive the thought that he had been betrayed by one of his own. No Illidari is without weakness. No Illidari is immune to temptation.\n\nThe Burning Legion knows this. Whatever flaw you have, the Legion will test it.\n\nBut until that day, let them fear us once again. These warglaives hold a measure of Kil'jaeden's power, so he was undoubtedly pleased to know that our kind was dying to their blades.\n\nHe will not be so pleased to see what we will do with these weapons next.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades\n\nThe countless nicks and gouges that mar the Aldrachi Warblades form a map of their violent history. These weapons have vanquished thousands of demons and absorbed their twisted souls. It is said that the warblades even drew the molten blood of the Burning Legion's ruler, Sargeras.\n\nTruly, there is extraordinary power in these otherworldly blades. In your hands, there is no telling what havoc they will wreak on the Legion.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part One\n\nThe scattered legends that remain of the ancient aldrachi speak of their unsurpassed skill as warriors. These proud people were bred from birth for combat. Their entire culture revolved around it. Military service was mandatory for all aldrachi, and it began as soon as a child could walk.\n\nSo it was with Toranaar. After he took his first step, he was cast into the merciless aldrachi war machine.\n\nHe came from a long line of respected warriors, and his elder brother was the greatest among them. Given Toranaar's pedigree, expectations for him were high. He would not disappoint.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Two\n\nToranaar endured years of brutal training, tests of strength meant to cull the weak from the strong. One thought propelled him through the pain and suffering: winning the right to carry warblades.\n\nMore than titles or wealth, the aldrachi coveted weapons as prized possessions and symbols of status. Warblades eclipsed all other types of arms in prestige. These mighty weapons were fashioned from rare crystals found deep below the earth. The strange minerals had many unique properties, the greatest of which was their ability to absorb the spirits of the dead. Blacksmiths employed closely guarded techniques to enchant these crystals and forge them into instruments of death.\n\nThe resultant warblades could consume the souls of their victims. Each devoured spirit imbued the weapon with greater power. The most ancient warblades contained thousands of souls, and they were revered just as much as-if not more than-the fearsome aldrachi warriors who bore them in battle.\n\nAs the young Toranaar lay in bed every night, his body bruised and broken, he pictured himself carrying warblades of his own. He willed that vision to become a reality.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Three\n\nToward the end of his training, Toranaar had his final and greatest test. The aldrachi military high command chose an elder warrior at random to battle the young initiate in a fight to the death. The day of the duel came, and Toranaar stepped into the ritual fighting pit to face his opponent.\n\nIt was his older brother.\n\nToranaar spared his sibling only a passing glance. He fixed his eyes on his opponent's gleaming warblades. Toranaar's dream was within reach, and nothing would keep him from it. Not even family.\n\nThe two brothers grappled through the night and into the next day. Both were on the verge of death when Toranaar finally disarmed his kin and took the warblades for himself. Without uttering a word, he buried the weapons in his brother's chest, and they drank deep of the fallen warrior's soul.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Four\n\nStories of the aldrachi reached the Burning Legion and its ruler, Sargeras. He and his demon army had decimated countless mortal civilizations in their quest to extinguish life from the cosmos. Sargeras was always eager to find mighty new races that he could bend to his will and use as agents of destruction. The aldrachi seemed like the perfect candidates for servitude.\n\nRather than destroy the aldrachi world outright, Sargeras ordered his forces to invade it. The Legion would wear the warriors thin until they were ripe for demonic conversion. Sargeras knew that his followers would suffer great losses against the enemy, but that did not discourage him.\n\nWhether it took a year, or ten, or a hundred... Sargeras would make the aldrachi his.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Five\n\nExcerpt from the nathrezim records known as The Codex of the Dead:\n\n\"Curious creatures, the aldrachi. Much more resilient and promising than anticipated.\n\n\"The Legion stormed their little world with overwhelming force, a sea of pit lords and felguard, of shivarra and mo'arg, ebbing and flowing from horizon to horizon. Still, the aldrachi held the invasion at bay. Hundreds of demons fell just to claim one of their warriors. The aldrachi fought like ravenous beasts, and none with more ferocity than the creature called Toranaar the Indomitable.\n\n\"His warblades howled over the clamor of battle, rending anything that came near. Each demon Toranaar vanquished seemed to fill him with renewed vigor and strength. He was an army unto himself.\"\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Six\n\nWave after wave of demons slammed into the aldrachi lines. Toranaar and other seasoned warriors repelled each attack, but the Legion's numbers never diminished. For every demon defeated, another would take its place. Slowly and methodically, the Legion whittled away the aldrachi resistance and pushed them back to the towering stronghold in the heart of their war-torn capital.\n\nOnly Toranaar and a handful of champions remained. Each of them carried warblades teeming with the souls of thousands of victims they had cut down. In all directions, corpses of aldrachi and demon alike blanketed the earth. It is said that not a bare patch of ground could be seen for leagues.\n\nToranaar rallied his allies in preparation for another Legion attack, but it never came. To the aldrachi's confusion, the demons halted their advance. A monstrous figure then emerged from the Legion's ranks.\n\nIt was Sargeras, and he had come with an offer for Toranaar.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Seven\n\nNo one knows for sure what form Sargeras took to confront Toranaar. Some nathrezim records say that the Legion's colossal ruler infused a sliver of his power into an avatar and dispatched it to the aldrachi stronghold. Whatever the truth, it is certain that he called for Toranaar to join the Legion.\n\nSargeras promised the aldrachi warrior and his allies power beyond anything they had ever dreamt of. They would serve as his personal guards, and they would command tens of thousands of demons in war. Sargeras believed that such an offer would prove irresistible to the battle-loving aldrachi.\n\nToranaar's rejection was emphatic. He vowed to destroy the Legion for all of the aldrachi the demons had killed, or die trying. Either way, he would never bow to Sargeras.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Eight\n\nDemons still whisper of the battle between Toranaar and Sargeras. The gathered Legion host watched with rapt attention as their ruler dueled with the aldrachi warrior. At any moment, Sargeras could have simply annihilated Toranaar, but destruction was not what he wanted.\n\nSargeras desired to corrupt the aldrachi champion, and he would need to exhaust Toranaar to succeed. For days, the Legion's ruler did so. Like a cruel predator toying with prey, Sargeras battered Toranaar with just enough force to wear him down.\n\nToranaar was a seasoned warrior, and he recognized Sargeras's ploy. He knew he could not best the Legion's commander in combat, and so he decided on one final act of defiance. Toranaar feigned submission. When Sargeras let his guard down, the aldrachi champion struck.\n\nHis warblades ripped through Sargeras's hide, and fire burst from the wound. Though it was only a minor injury, the other aldrachi howled in triumph.\n\nIt was the last time such war cries would ever echo through their once-great capital.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Nine\n\nToranaar's defiance infuriated Sargeras. In an instant, he ripped the warrior and his fellow aldrachi champions to pieces. So great was Sargeras's wrath that nothing was left of their bodies but dust. The Legion's ruler then commanded his armies to bathe the aldrachi world in an inferno that would smolder for eternity.\n\nThough Sargeras had failed to corrupt the aldrachi, all was not lost. He had left the warblades used by Toranaar and his kin intact. If the aldrachi would not serve the Legion, their formidable weapons would.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Ten\n\nSargeras ordered his lieutenant Kil'jaeden the Deceiver to distribute the warblades of the aldrachi. Over thousands of years, the demon sought out the Legion's greatest warriors. Those who met Kil'jaeden's standards received a set of warblades. In demonic hands, these weapons went on to massacre civilizations, exterminate entire races, and consume the souls of a hundred thousand dead.\n\nIn time, Kil'jaeden had circulated all of the warblades, save the ones that had belonged to Toranaar. These were the most powerful arms taken from the aldrachi. Kil'jaeden kept them under close watch, awaiting a champion ruthless enough to wield the fabled weapons that had made Sargeras bleed.\n\nThe Aldrachi Warblades, Part Eleven\n\nAfter years of waiting, Kil'jaeden found someone worthy of wielding Toranaar's warblades. Her name was Caria Felsoul, and she was one of the Illidari's most cunning and adept demon hunters.\n\nCaria had willingly turned on the Illidari and pledged herself to the Legion in exchange for power, and Kil'jaeden rewarded her. He flooded the demon hunter with dark energy and molded her into his perfect servant. Before unleashing Caria on his enemies, he gifted her the Aldrachi Warblades.\n\nKil'jaeden relished this final act, knowing it stood against everything Toranaar had fought for. The aldrachi had used his warblades to uphold the dignity of his people and reject Sargeras's offer of power. Wielded by a traitor like Caria, the weapons would become tools of betrayal, murder, and dishonor.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on, my master.

He would converse with the gods of the abyss, and he would find them dull, witless creatures.\n\nHis down was an inky midnight, and his children were the dread ravens.\n\nSethe was cold-blooded and scornful. When he flew, the wind bit his flesh. He would sun himself on the mountainsides, but he could never taste warmth.\n\nHis scales were frosted glass, and his children were the wind serpents.\n\nSethe coveted the favor of the wind and the warmth of the sun. He persuaded Anzu to help him slay Rukhmar and take the sky for themselves.\n\nBut Anzu was cunning, and cared little for the wind serpents. In the dark of night, he sent a raven to warn Rukhmar of Sethe's intentions.\n\nAnzu watched from the top of a mountain spire as Rukhmar and Sethe clashed.\n\nSethe struck exactly as Anzu had warned, and Rukhmar avoided him with ease.

I was not attuned to mystical power. I could never rise to glory in war. So instead I resolved to chronicle the actions of those who could. I began with Odyn himself, telling the stories of his greatest battles and achievements as he cleansed the Black Empire from Azeroth.\n\nNow I will record the actions of his followers. Countless vrykul have sought Odyn's favor through acts of heroism. They deserve to be remembered in this life and the next?. and if I can help them achieve immortality among the living, perhaps they will invite me to join their number in the Halls of Valor and tell their tales for all eternity.\n\n-Anonymous\n\nHis Name is Dragonblood\n\nAfter the dark masters of the Black Empire fell before the might of the titan-forged, the aqir were silent for centuries. But they were not idle. They rested in their underground burrows, plotting, scheming, building their numbers, believing that the Old Gods would rise again one day.\n\nThey hid themselves well. They made their warrens deep below the ground. Few vrykul could track them beneath the deserts of the southwest.\n\nA vrykul warrior named Oktel resolved to learn their secrets. He spent years wandering the barren sands alone, studying the ways of the aqir. Slowly, carefully, he identified their habits, their territory, and their weaknesses. His observations were recorded and distributed among other vrykul, greatly aiding them in their raids. If given enough time, he was certain he could uncover the aqir's hidden labyrinths of burrows.\n\nThe aqir refused to let that happen. They laid a false trail, waited for him to follow it alone, and then struck. They rose up as a swarm, filling the sky, attacking him from all directions. They tore Oktel near to pieces and left him to die slowly in the blistering heat, meaning his fate to be a warning to the rest of his kind.\n\nFor three days and nights he suffered, lacking the strength to move. Yet he lived.\n\nOn the fourth day he was found by a red dragon. Wondrous, massive, and powerful, she circled above and called out to Oktel. \"I cannot imagine your agony,\" she said. \"Why have you clung to life for so long?\"\n\n\"I have too much left to do,\" Oktel replied.\n\n\"I can return you to the care of your people,\" the dragon said.\n\n\"My work is not done. Lend me a morsel of your strength, and I will return to my people on my own, with a collection of aqiri heads in my grasp,\" Oktel said.\n\nThe red dragon stood beside him and opened one of her veins. Her blood mingled with his, and Oktel felt his might returning. \"I am the Life-Binder. I lend you this power not to take life, but to protect it,\" she said. \"The aqir will kill many creatures if left unchallenged. Go on, warrior, and finish your quest.\"\n\nOktel stood and walked deep into the deserts, finding the aqir's biggest warren. He kept his word, destroying the aqir that had attacked him and crushing their countless clutches of eggs. He returned to his people with the skulls of insect lords strung together around his neck. The vrykul called him a new name: Oktel Dragonblood.\n\nIn time he would be the thane of his people, a fierce warrior in battle but a compassionate cultivator of life in peace. After his death, he was honored by vrykul and dragons alike. \n\nMay he now have the relief he so richly earned.\n\nThe Last Words of Asgrim the Dreadkiller\n\n\"You see it, yes? We must have driven Helya to true fury. That is her prize on the horizon, sailing for us now.\n\n\"Let there be no doubt: we will die this day. That is the dread ship Naglfar, and it will blast our vessel into splinters. And then what will happen? Its crew will pluck us from the waters and slit our throats, and the Naglfar will ferry our souls to Helheim, where Helya will strip us clean of all that makes us mighty and great and free. She wants nothing less than to force our servitude and obedience for eternity.\n\n\"Let her try! Let her Kvaldir puppets rush to oblivion! Together we have sent thousands of those cursed, befouled creatures back to their hell. We have saved countless vrykul souls from her clutches.\n\n\"We will die, but we will bring their crew down to the depths with us! Keep death's song in your heart and a blade between your teeth, even as your blood rushes free. If a single one of their crew is left alive, all of our souls are forfeit. But if they die with us, the Naglfar will sail on and return to Helya... empty of our souls and theirs. Let our dying breaths rob Helheim of its faithful.\n\n\"Here it comes. I expect to see each and every one of you in the Halls shortly.\n\n\"Open fire.\"\n\n\nA Shieldmaiden's Creed\n\nShieldmaiden Iounn was her name. Her raids took her to the north, to the east, and to the west. Never did she flinch from battle. Countless enemies fell before her. But while her comrades celebrated each victory, she did not.\n\n\"That is in the past,\" she would say. \"Let us look forward.\"\n\nYears passed. Her travels took her across Azeroth. Her battles begat great tales of bravery and power. Yet she still did not celebrate. Looking forward, not back, was her eternal creed.\n\nWhen Ashildir began her quest to form the Valkyra, she called upon the mightiest women among all the vrykul to join her. Dark forces were working against Odyn and the Halls of Valor. The future of their people was at stake.\n\nShieldmaiden Iounn answered. \"Ashildir has set her sights past this life and onto the next. I will help.\"\n\n\nIounn became a stalwart defender of the Valkyra, a thorn in Helya's side. Time and time again, she thwarted Helya's plans to destroy the Halls of Valor.But all of it was nearly for naught. Ashildir herself died in battle. Helya's minions sought her remains, hoping to snatch her soul for Helheim. None but Iounn stood against them. Bravely she fought, ignoring wounds and fatigue. She carried Ashildir home to Stormheim, where she was laid to rest. Her spirit ascended, and she would forever serve as the queen of the Valkyra.\n\nIounn had been badly injured. She lay next to Ashildir's grave and waited for her life's end. She raised her shield one last time in salute, and passed away with a smile on her face.\n\nAnd when her spirit was raised, she joined Ashildir's side once more to continue her work as a defender of the Valarjar Valkyra. Iounn had rested enough. She was looking forward yet again.\n\n\nThe Prophecy of Rythas the Oracle\n\nOur world is young. It sleeps, troubled with dreams.\nI have known its slumber. I have felt its heart beat.\nDarkness seeks to claim it.\nBeneath the land, chaos. Beneath the sea, patient menace.\nOur hope lies in the sky. Odyn's refuge must stand.\n\nThe world's soul is weak. It will one day be strong.\nOnly the worthy can protect it.\nDo not fear death. To live as a vrykul is to know danger.\nA glorious death will not be the end.\nThe second life begins in the sky.

Its gates barred, its heroes spurned.\nA champion will rise and break them free.\nThe champion's face is hidden; their name is cloaked. What power will this creature hold?\nIt will arise in time. It will save us all.\nIt will ensure that Odyn's refuge will stand.\n\nThe Lessons of the Blackfist\n\nVrykul defend this world. It is our duty, our task, our solemn vow. Yet we share this world with many other creatures, lesser mortals of diminished power and strength. Most are selfish, insignificant beings. Some have a sense of order and honor. A rare few have the fortitude to achieve true might, wielding the powers that drift in and out of our realm with skill and cunning.\n\nA vrykul warrior, Heimir of the Black Fist, took it upon himself to seek out native creatures as he traveled. He was driven by curiosity. Most vrykul dismissed these outsiders as worthless. Could any of them rise to something more?\n\nMost creatures fled the moment they saw him, and for good reason. Even among vrykul, Heimir's size and stature were formidable. But sometimes, they would come back, observing him from a distance. Heimir did not mind. With every sunrise, he would rise from sleep and practice with his sword and shield. The visitors watched him carefully.\n\nHeimir showed them the rudiments of battle. He demonstrated the forms and techniques that would lay the foundation for honorable warfare. And then, weeks later, he would stop. He would sit in a clearing, his sword on his lap, waiting alone. For days he would wait. Weeks. Months, at times.\n\nEventually, one of the curious mortals would approach. Sometimes they had made primitive blades-or if they lacked metalworking knowledge, they had chopped trees into heavy wooden practice swords. That was always a good sign. Those who made the effort were rewarded.\n\nHeimir never knew their language, and they knew not his. So they communicated the only way they could: Heimir would raise his blade, wait for them to raise theirs, and then begin sparring. Did any of them rise to the skill of even a novice vrykul? No. But that was no surprise. They were primitive mortals, not titan-forged warriors.\n\nHeimir would remain there, training, until they showed that they had truly developed a warrior's spirit. Then he would leave. He would not return until generations had passed.\n\nAnd in that time, the warrior tradition grew. The students would continue their training. They would become masters and instruct new acolytes in their ways. Heimir no longer needed to teach them the basics. He would train them in new, advanced techniques. Then he would leave. Generations later, he would build their knowledge yet again.\n\nHeimir's dream was simple. Perhaps these outsiders would become mighty warriors in their own right, equal to any vrykul. But for as long as he lived, none ever defeated him in sparring.\n\nAnd yet he never despaired. It is the duty of the vrykul to defend this world. How better to spend his time than to teach its weakest the ways of strength?\n\nVolund's Folly\n\nPower can be earned. It can be created. It can be lent. But when it is stolen, there will always be a price to pay.\n\nHeed the tale of Volund the Hoarder.\n\nBrave and clever, studious and wise, he was an astonishing force on the battlefield. The enemies of Odyn quailed before Volund. His blade, his bow, and his spear secured many victories and earned him much honor. His attentions were drawn to the ancient and mysterious leavings of the Black Empire. The war between the titans and the Old Gods had left countless fragments of power scattered across Azeroth. The instruments of the Old Gods were too dangerous to touch, so Volund destroyed them wherever he found them.\n\nBut the artifacts of the titans were valuable treasures. They often imparted incredible power to Volund on the battlefield. He had been skilled before; he was unstoppable now. He moved faster, struck harder, and carried vastly outnumbered warbands to victory. Any artifacts he couldn't use himself, he would lend to other warriors, granting them marvelous abilities.\n\nYet he was not satisfied. Once he had collected enough of the titans' power for himself, he could single-handedly destroy every enemy on Azeroth and ensure eternal peace. So he believed.\n\nVolund eventually located something that might have made his dreams come true. An ancient titan construct, built for war against the Old Gods' most powerful abominations, was resting beneath a mountain range near Stormheim. If it were awoken, Volund believed it would roam Azeroth on its own, eradicating all traces of evil and chaos. Volund studied it for years before attempting to raise it back to life.\n\nHe succeeded. The construct awoke, and lashed out at all living creatures. This was why it had been destroyed and buried in the first place: the Old Gods' minions had corrupted it, turning its purpose against the allies of the titans.\n\nThough Volund survived his first contact with it, the construct seemed to be unstoppable. It turned toward the nearest bastion of the titan-forged, Stormheim itself, and marched to destroy it. It might have succeeded. Volund collected all of his treasures, all of his artifacts, all of his hoarded instruments, and brought them to bear against the construct.\n\nThere was a great flash of light, and then a great silence. The construct, along with Volund, was no more. \n\nVolund had saved Stormheim from his folly. And may we all learn from his errors. Power must be respected, guarded, and carefully curated.\n\n", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "15105", "title": "Mysterious Wreckage", "text": "You have found the wreckage of a mysterious object.

Their victory is a vehicle to the realization that without resorting to what they define as deplorability to achieve it, we would have overcome them instead. In both outcomes, win or lose, the Scourge invariably wins. When this is recognized, submission to our will is inevitable.\n\nThe Master, our Lich King, was born under this very same doctrine.\n\nTo conquer is to corrupt. To corrupt is to take what it is to be righteous and hopeful, to be living, and invert it through any means in your arsenal. The attributes of the living all have synonyms with fatal flaws that are their undoing: hope is dogma, righteousness is zealotry, living is empathy. Recognize what makes that which lives desire to live, and turn it upon itself.\n\nKnowing the most direct path of corruption is the pinnacle of wisdom. A simple weakening of the heart, dismemberment of vital organs, or direct disease will work for most. However the conquer of most is not the decree of the Master, but the conquer of all. It is foolish to spend excessive resources in warping the mind of a simple peasant where common plague will suffice, but it is equally unwise to try the same common plague against the seasoned and hearty. Regimented study of any formidability will reveal useable weaknesses.\n\nThe Decree of the Scourge\nChapter 2\n\nThe largest misconception the living have of the Scourge is our penchant for what is considered 'evil.' For the sake of demoralization we allow this error to perpetuate, and indeed spread it on our own. The true nature of The Scourge is our transcendence of the shackles that keep any of the living races from becoming as prosperous as we.\n\nFor example: What benefits do emotion and honor really hold? They serve to validate the living, to make them feel 'good.' Now, what flaws do they hold? Emotion is directly correlated to the ignorance of logic and reason. Honor is, at most times, the sole perpetuator of able resources fighting a losing battle. It is baffling even to me that the living can be so unaware of how eager we are to play the part of their villain, to nurture their greatest flaws by becoming the embodiment of all that incites irrational behavior.\n\nMoral ambiguity cannot be 'cleansed.' Antipathy cannot be 'healed' or 'assuaged.' Greed cannot be 'dispelled' and wrath cannot be 'cured.' We choose to be the embodiment of all these things, and yet there are some still foolish enough to believe that the Scourge can be defeated and removed completely. So long as the most attractive sins of the living remain our banner flag, there will always be those eager to flock to our will. \n\nI myself was born under this doctrine.\n\nThe Decree of the Scourge\nChapter 3\n\nThe Scourge is infinite in potential. We are not, however, infallible by any means. Always be well aware of your limits, and the resources at your disposal. Always have an exit strategy. Sacrifice of eager minions to your ends is a cornerstone of Scourge philosophy. All manner of bravery, martyrdom, or compatriotism for anyone but the Master is imprudent and severely punishable.\n\nAnother fallacy outsiders hold of the Scourge is that our power resides in the residual will of the living, that we are an advanced form of parasite, and without a host of regenerating life would simply wither away. Again we do not deny such ignorant thought for our benefit, but this could not be further from the truth. We are nothing but an ever-improving form of adaptation to a land once riddled with endless struggle. We are immune to the tribulations of dissention, over-population, individuality, selfish opinion, short-sightedness, and even mortality. We hear the will of the Master, and the Master brings us all that we will ever desire.\n\nIt is true that we take architecture, technology, and physical prowess from assimilated cultures. This, like the so many 'evil' acts of the Scourge, is done entirely out of pragmatism. The Scourge has neither the time nor the desire to generate a culture of its own. A member of the Scourge that creates without influence will hold an inherent attachment to it, a right to see it viewed and used. This leads to individuality, which leads to dissention. Creativity is a flaw of culture, but a minor obligation when dealing with simple needs like buildings and equipment. It is not your duty to question or care of the origins of your resources, only in how usable they are.\n\nThe Scourge is the will of the land. All manner of life kneel to our will with an ease that yields a single conclusion: That they need us, they yearn for our salvation. There is no resilience to our practices, no immunity to our commandments. We are every bit the inevitability that a natural life holds: Death. Death comes with every life, and undeath comes with every death. The sooner the living recognizes this immutable fact, the easier their transition will be.", "authors": ["Kel'Thuzad "]}, {"id": "15111", "title": "The Angler and the Monks", "text": "Two wise monks gathered beneath the Temple of the Jade Serpent to discuss the nature of truth. Because the seas were glassy and calm, they decided to hire an Angler to row them out beyond the spires so that they may admire the view as they talked. \"Glassy waters mean storms ahead,\" the Angler cautioned, but the wise monks trusted their eyes and insisted on the voyage.\n\n\"Truth is absolute,\" said the first monk, as the little boat emerged into open water. \"The universe has but one truth, and we must work tirelessly to reveal it.\"\n\n\"Truth is relative!\" countered the second monk, as clouds gathered overhead. \"The universe has many truths, and only the fool insists that his truth is true for all.\"\n\nThe Angler said nothing as the monks debated, until at last one turned to him and asked for his opinion on the nature of truth. \"I never thought much about it,\" he admitted.\n\nThe two monks shook their heads and clicked their tongues. They were alarmed to discover that the Angler did not even know how to read or write. \"It would seem to us that you have wasted your life,\" they said to him.\n\nAt that moment, thunder and lightning tore open the sky as if it were a sheet, and a great rain poured down. The little boat soon became swamped and flipped over. Casting off his overcoat, the Angler began swimming for the shore.\n\n\"Help us!\" the monks called out, as the swells began to crash around them. \"We cannot swim!\"The Angler answered: \"It would seem to me that you have wasted your lives!\"", "authors": ["Unknown "]}, {"id": "15113", "title": "The Chronicle of Ages", "text": "The Chronicle of Ages\n\nAs recorded by the chroniclers of the Broken Temple.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion\n\nYou may have heard that this legendary staff was once carried by a hozen. That concerned us. A lot. We examined it thoroughly, and you will be pleased to hear that there was no damage done to this artifact (that we cannot fix).\n\nAnd as it turns out, we weren't giving the Monkey King enough credit. He is not the most reverent creature on Azeroth, but he has a healthy respect for this weapon. He even helped us understand its true power. Fu Zan has certainly been through a strange journey.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part One\n\nLong ago, Keeper Freya sculpted an ethereal plane of existence, the Emerald Dream, to act as a guide for Azeroth's natural life. She crafted and planted one tree near the powerful energy of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.\n\nIt grew strong and tall, drinking deeply from the vale's resonant power. More trees arose around it. Lush forests, both in the Dream and in the waking world, sprang to life across the region. Keeper Freya named the tree Fu Zan and shaped one of its branches into a walking stick for her long journeys.\n\nFrom the beginning, this staff has accompanied legendary creatures and immortal spirits as they carried out important, lasting work all across Azeroth.\n\nIt also fell into the possession of the Monkey King. That came later.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Two\n\nIn the early days of Azeroth's revival, natural life flourished strongly in the enclaves where the keeper Freya did her most intensive work. A small number of exceptional wild animals grew far beyond expectations, showing such remarkable power that they would soon be known as the Wild Gods.\n\nEach of these beings had a different personality, but Freya noticed that four in particular shared a deep commitment to peace and wisdom. These four-a serpent, an ox, a crane, and a tiger-had gathered near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Freya knew their compassion would aid the region well. Indeed, they would be called the August Celestials by the inhabitants of Pandaria.\n\nOne day, Freya came to the celestials with concern in her heart. There was a great darkness in the north, she told them, and she believed a confrontation was near. She gave them her staff for safekeeping. \"If I do not see you again, return this staff to Azeroth, to one of its children,\" she said. \"Give it to someone who loathes battle and loves peace.\"\n\nFreya never returned. Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent, vowed to keep the staff safe. For thousands of years, even during the dark reign of the mogu empire, she did just that.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Three\n\nIn the south, near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, many new creatures arose, forming tribes, villages, and even empires. There were the jinyu, the pandaren, the hozen, and others.\n\nYu'lon suspected that, if Fu Zan would pass to one of these beings, it would go to a jinyu or a pandaren. Surely the hozen were too innately violent to be trusted with such a gift. They were often selfish and shortsighted, unable to work together long enough to build a proper civilization of their own.\n\nBut as time passed, Yu'lon questioned her assumptions. There were different forms of wisdom and courage, were there not? It was easy to see the short-lived, short-tempered hozen as troublemakers, but they lived full lives-wild lives-in the years they had.\n\nYu'lon felt Fu Zan begin to awaken. It needed a new companion. The Jade Serpent knew that soon she would honor Freya's wishes and allow a worthy mortal to carry Fu Zan. And she was becoming certain that it needed to be given to a hozen.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Four\n\n\"Give it to someone who loathes battle and loves peace.\"\n\nFreya's words became clear the moment Yu'lon laid eyes upon one exceptional hozen. He called himself the Monkey King.\n\nLong ago, only a few years before the War of the Ancients, he had become the leader of an ungovernable people. He had risen to power without spilling a single drop of blood. He was beloved by every hozen tribe.\n\nHow had he done this? After all, hozen fought endlessly. Constantly. For the simplest reasons. Any disagreement meant physical violence.\n\nThe Monkey King knew this. So he told the hozen tribes, \"I am the Monkey King. Your tribe supports me with all its heart.\" That was all. When a single hozen would question him, he would tell them that their tribe's leader had already agreed to it. No hozen wanted to challenge their leader on a whim-and be in a fight-so they declared, \"You are the Monkey King.\"\n\nWhen the tribe leaders learned his name, all of their subjects were already calling him the Monkey King. They were confused, but they did not want to fight their people, so they did not challenge him either. The Monkey King's wild claim, his lie, eventually became true because nobody dared to disagree with it.\n\nSoon tribal fighting had ceased. The Monkey King passed judgment on all disputes. The hozen obeyed.\n\nThe Jade Serpent could see the Monkey King's motivation. It was simple: he disliked the sight of blood. At the most fundamental level, this was a creature who loathed battle and loved peace. And from that, he had achieved what no other hozen ever had.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Five\n\nYu'lon needed to know how deep the Monkey King's cleverness ran. She visited him in disguise. All the Monkey King saw was another hozen... but this one did not call him king or bow before him. He demanded that she show respect.\n\nInstead, the newcomer asked him a riddle, telling him that a true king would have no trouble answering it. He snapped out the correct answer in seconds. She gave him another. He answered again. On and on they went, for three days and three nights. The Monkey King grew enraged, but even in his anger, he continued to answer her questions.\n\nYu'lon was convinced. Violence and tyranny were not in the Monkey King's nature, or he would have tried to shut her up with force long ago. She revealed her true form-which caused considerable chaos in that hozen village-and presented him with Fu Zan.\n\nThe Jade Serpent told him the story of Freya and how the staff had come to be. Then she warned him: she sensed that, one day, his cleverness would not be enough to stop evil. When that day came, he would need to act decisively.\n\nThe Monkey King did not believe her. But he did think the staff was very, very pretty.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Six\n\nWith Fu Zan in his grasp, the Monkey King's authority over the hozen became absolute. He could bend like a willow in the wind, avoiding any blow from a challenger to the throne. The staff was as light as a feather, and yet anyone who tried to steal it found they could not lift it an inch. It was his; no one else was allowed to wield it.\n\nBut there was a serious problem with Fu Zan. To look regal while carrying it, the Monkey King needed to use two hands. That meant he had no free hand for his most prized possession, a small keg that he always kept filled with brew.\n\nBut that was easy to solve. The Monkey King had two metal bands added to the end of Fu Zan and hung his keg from them. Luckily, the staff was not permanently damaged.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Seven\n\nThe Monkey King became fast friends with a young pandaren prince, Shaohao. The day of Shaohao's coronation, the new emperor learned that all of the land was at risk of being destroyed by the Burning Legion's first invasion of Azeroth.\n\nThe Monkey King believed that Yu'lon's prophecy had come to pass: this was the day he needed to face evil directly. He declared that he would stay by Shaohao's side until the end.\n\nBut fate had other plans. A great, ill wind roared from the east and carried the Monkey King far away.\n\nThe Monkey King was blown into the lands of the mantid. All of his cleverness counted for nothing there. He was helpless, about to die at their hands, when Shaohao rescued him. The Monkey King was enraged, but the mantid were not his enemy. Shaohao reminded him that the Burning Legion was the true threat.\n\nAnd in the end, it was not violence that saved the peoples of Pandaria. Shaohao released his spirit to the land, shrouding it in mist and protecting it from the destruction of the Sundering.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Eight\n\nThe Monkey King went home and hurled Fu Zan into a river in a fit of rage. His friend had vanished, and the Monkey King had seemingly failed Yu'lon's prophecy.\n\nEventually he went to the river to retrieve the staff, but only because those waters were sacred for a jinyu tribe, and they could not remove it themselves-it was too heavy. It still belonged to the Monkey King.\n\nAfter the Sundering, Pandaria was isolated from the rest of the world. The emperor was gone. There would never be another.\n\nSome believed that all the other lands had been destroyed. Others wanted to explore the world beyond the mists. And a few wanted to claim Pandaria for themselves. With force.\n\nNot much has been written of this brief surge of would-be tyrants. Very few of Pandaria's denizens were harmed by any of them. Whether they were mogu warlords, fringe hozen tribes, or even brutal yaungol raiders, none of them ever launched a true campaign of conquest. Before they could, they were always approached by a mysterious hozen who would chatter endlessly about a hidden cache of artifacts that had granted him untold power. He could demonstrate miracles-no weapon could touch him, no matter how many combatants tried to attack him.\n\nIt was very convincing. These ambitious, greedy beings would eagerly follow the Monkey King's directions. Sometimes they would walk off a cliff. Sometimes they would find themselves ambushed by Shado-Pan. In any case, their story always came to a quick end, and the Monkey King would stride away, Fu Zan resting easily across his shoulders.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Nine\n\nThe Monkey King had never had such fun. Turning evil beings into stumbling fools became his most cherished pastime for years. He saw it as his way of honoring his old friend Shaohao, who now watched over the land but could no longer protect Pandaria's peoples directly.\n\nBut just as Yu'lon had told him, his cleverness would one day not be enough to defeat evil.\n\nA mogu despot called the Jade Warlord had followed the Monkey King's directions, traveling deep into a tomb beneath Kun-Lai. But rather than finding nothing--as the hozen had expected--the Jade Warlord found an ancient cache of knowledge written by the Thunder King, Lei Shen. In the warlord's hands, it would grant him terrible, awful power.\n\nThe Monkey King knew he had made a mistake... and as the ground began to shake, he knew there was no time for anyone else to stop the mogu. He took Fu Zan and went into the tomb to deal with the problem directly.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Ten\n\nThe Monkey King loathed violence. He detested it. But he also knew he was the only one who could oppose the Jade Warlord before it was too late.\n\nThe two of them dueled beneath Kun-Lai for hours. For years, Fu Zan had been an aid to the Monkey King's mischief-that proved to be excellent practice for avoiding the powerful, lethal magic the mogu soon unleashed.\n\nThe Monkey King believed he would not leave the tomb alive that day. Indeed, he did not. But he was not killed. The Jade Warlord had no command of his new power, and an errant spell did what neither of them expected: it froze them both in jade. They remained there, locked in battle, for almost ten thousand years, able to communicate all the while.\n\nThat must have been a fate worse than death for the mogu.\n\nFu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion,Part Eleven\n\nOnce the Monkey King was freed, he traveled to the Timeless Isle and watched as the August Celestials taught the champions of Azeroth lessons in strength, endurance, courage, and wisdom. After some time had passed, the Monkey King sensed that his travels with Fu Zan were nearing their end. So, he traveled to the temple of Yu'lon and passed the staff back into her care so that one day it can again be given up to another who is worthy to wield it.\n\nHe was even happy to hear that it would soon be carried into battle again.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists\n\nDo you know of Shaohao? Of Kang, the Fist of First Dawn? Of Xuen, the White Tiger? Do you know of the terrible trials the pandaren people overcame thousands of years ago?\n\nSheilun is living proof that conflict can be endured, that tyranny can be overcome, that disaster can be averted... and that a caring heart can make it all possible. Sheilun will aid you greatly in the tribulations to come. Carry it with pride, and use it to bring your comrades home alive.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part One\n\n\"It feels strange to call Sheilun powerful, does it not? You could not use it to flatten a mountain with a single blow, nor could you use it to burn a thousand enemies alive with a single thought. Others might find that disappointing. But you are a monk. You know power takes many forms. Others desire the might of a waterfall crashing down on the rocks. You seek the calm, inevitable force of a deep river, the kind that carves canyons into the toughest stone and carries away warriors on its currents without so much as a ripple. Sheilun is the embodiment of that idea.\"\n\n-Master Xunsu, Mistweaver of the Terrace of Endless Spring\n\nThis staff has seen many battles in Pandaria. It was there when a slave toppled an empire of slavemasters. It was there when an emperor saved an entire continent from death.\n\nSheilun contains the legacy of ancient days and ancient spirits. In the hands of those who help others, this staff is very powerful indeed.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Two\n\nLong before the Sundering, long before the southern end of Azeroth was known as Pandaria, there was an explosion of life in a particular valley. Four animal spirits were drawn to that place, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and they were in awe at its potential... and its power. At that time, dark forces had eyes on the vale's secrets. A titan keeper and his armies of mogu protected the land from the mantid and other outside threats, but there was no guidance for what was growing within.\n\nThese four spirits chose to make this place their home. They were Xuen, the White Tiger; Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent; Chi-Ji, the Red Crane; and Niuzao, the Black Ox. They would become known as the August Celestials.\n\nUnder their care, many different life forms emerged near the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Among them were the wise jinyu, the mischievous hozen, and the peaceful pandaren. They worshipped the August Celestials, and in return, the spirits offered them knowledge and guidance. For a time, there was peace.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Three\n\nThe peace of the vale did not last. The terror of the Thunder King shattered everything.\n\nA mogu warlord named Lei Shen revolted against his master, the keeper Ra-den, seizing his power and crowning himself the emperor of all mogu... and of all who lived within his domain. He enslaved those who surrendered and killed those who did not. First he conquered the small, fledgling jinyu empire and their hozen rivals. The pandaren fled to the harsh climate of Kun-Lai Summit, seeking the protection of Xuen, the White Tiger.\n\nXuen offered them sanctuary for a time. But soon, Lei Shen brought an army to the Kun-Lai foothills. Rather than launching an attack, he issued a challenge: Xuen would come forth and duel with the Thunder King. Victory meant the pandaren would live free. Defeat meant the enslavement of them all. Refusal meant summary execution.\n\nXuen accepted the challenge. The duel between the celestial of strength and the Thunder King shook the skies for days. In the end, Xuen fell. Lei Shen did not have him killed; instead he took him to the highest peak, Mount Neverest, and had him bound there, forced to watch the pandaren being led into an era of slavery that would last for thousands of years.\n\nBut although Xuen was imprisoned, he was not idle. It is here that the story of this staff truly begins.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Four\n\nFor millennia, Xuen was alone, able to do nothing but watch the mogu empire inflict unforgivable cruelty on its slaves. Then he saw the seeds of revolution take hold.\n\nIt began with a single pandaren, Kang, who believed the mogu empire's reliance on slave labor made it weak. He learned how to fight without weapons, using the strength of his opponents against them, and taught it to many others. Soon he and his followers escaped to Kun-Lai, where they honed their abilities and philosophies in secret. One day Kang climbed to the top of Mount Neverest to meditate, and instead found Xuen.\n\nThe White Tiger's isolation had not made him angry or bitter. It had simply made him eager to help. He guided Kang and the other novice monks in the ways of strength-not simply the strength of raw power, but the strength of endurance. \"Look to the little life you can find in these heights,\" Xuen told him, \"and you will know strength.\"\n\nKang looked, and saw scattered, isolated trees growing along the Kun-Lai ridgelines. They were twisted and gnarled, but he soon understood they needed to be. They had to endure biting winds and harsh sleet. Their trunks needed to be sturdy and strong, their roots deep.\n\nIt was those trees that formed the walls of the monks' monastery and supplied the wood from which they crafted their first weapons-not blades, as their enemies had, but staves. Kang brought his to Xuen, who blessed it. Kang named it \"Sheilun,\" after his son, who had died to the mogu's cruelty years before.\n\nKang carried Sheilun for years, all throughout the Pandaren Revolution. The staff did not win the war. It was Kang's words that galvanized the mogu's slaves, and it was Kang's will that drove him onward when all seemed lost. On some days, Sheilun was a mere walking stick. But some days it was all that kept the mogu's swords and axes from carving his heart from his chest.\n\nSheilun was there the day Kang died, as he gave his life to topple the last mogu emperor. With that sacrifice, the former slave freed all of Pandaria.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Five\n\nSheilun was brought back to the monastery in the mountains, serving as a quiet symbol of what could be accomplished through the strength of inner harmony. The monastery itself, however, was not quiet at all. It had never been busier.\n\nXuen warned the monks that, although they were free, they had inherited the responsibility to protect Pandaria from the evil minds that wished to claim it. Every one hundred years, the mantid--dangerous insectoid creatures--would swarm the land. All that stood in their way were the brave souls who would fight atop the Serpent's Spine, a great wall protecting Pandaria from the mantid's ravaging mayhem.\n\nThe monks who remained in Kun-Lai dedicated themselves to preparing for this threat. And every one hundred years, pandaren monks lined the top of the Serpent's Spine to face the overwhelming waves of mantid and risk their lives to protect their land. Xuen would always allow one mistweaver to carry Sheilun into this centennial battle.\n\nIt is impossible to say how many lives were saved by those who carried this staff. It is impossible to say how many of its bearers died in service to Pandaria. But their sacrifices were not in vain. The wall still stands, even today.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Six\n\nAlmost ten thousand years ago, this staff passed into the possession of the last emperor of Pandaria. Perhaps you've heard his story. But please understand: before Emperor Shaohao became a legend, he was an untested, uncertain young pandaren, completely unaware of the burdens he would bear.\n\nOn the day of Shaohao's coronation, a monk from Kun-Lai presented him with the gift of Sheilun. The new emperor did not know its importance. He did not even recognize the monk as being sent by Xuen, the White Tiger; he merely thought it was a pretty ornament. Shaohao believed he was destined for a life of comfort and ease. Pandaria had been a peaceful land for generations. Why would he believe that would change?\n\nA jinyu waterspeaker received a vision of the future that shook Shaohao's confidence: soon, very soon, an army of demons would invade Azeroth, and the damage would be catastrophic. Pandaria would not survive the devastation that would follow.\n\nShaohao was greatly distressed. He sought out the advice of Yu'lon, the Jade Serpent, who told him he would save no one if he did not rein in his emotions, which were out of control and dangerous.\n\nShaohao would travel Pandaria in search of the wisdom that would save his land. This staff, Xuen's gift, it accompanied him. This journey would change Pandaria forever.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Seven\n\nShaohao set out on his travels with his friend, the mischievous and playful Monkey King. Before they got far, a great wind surrounded them. The Monkey King was carried away, disappearing into the distance. It was an event unlike any Shaohao had ever seen, and he soon found himself struggling to keep up.\n\nDoubt and despair rose up in the emperor's mind... and then they rose up outside of his mind, taking form as monstrous creatures. When the Jade Serpent told him his emotions were dangerous, she had been speaking of the sha, ancient shadows of a fallen Old God. The terrifying Sha of Doubt and the Sha of Despair confronted Shaohao. To dispel them, Shaohao had to listen to Chi-Ji, the Red Crane, and let go of those emotions, ridding himself of their burdens.\n\nHe continued his pursuit of his friend, following him all the way across the Serpent's Spine and into the land of the mantid.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Eight\n\nWhen Shaohao looked upon the mantid lands from the Serpent's Spine, he was frozen with fear. To cross into their territory was to risk almost certain death. The Sha of Fear held him immobile, paralyzing his thoughts. Niuzao, the Black Ox, was there to remind him that fear only controlled his mind, not his feet. Shaohao understood, wrested himself free of fear, and walked on.\n\nShaohao saved the Monkey King from the mantid's clutches and brought them both back to safety. Now, without fear or despair or doubt, Shaohao believed himself ready to face the Burning Legion's might.\n\nBut he saw no need to face it alone. He wanted an army to command, so he climbed Kun-Lai... and finally came face to face with Xuen.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Nine\n\nThe monastery atop Kun-Lai had changed over the years. What had once been the only refuge for free minds was now the training grounds for the most dedicated fighters in the land. These were the souls who trained to fight the mantid and all of Pandaria's other enemies.\n\nShaohao came to them confidently, demanding that they submit to his authority. Xuen saw that he was carrying his coronation gift-this staff, Sheilun-but that it had been nothing more to him than a walking stick. The White Tiger also saw that the emperor had rid himself of a great many dangerous emotions... but not anger. No, Shaohao's anger toward the Legion made him brash and reckless.\n\n\"Why do you fight?\" Xuen asked.\n\n\"To destroy demon hordes! To crush those that oppose me!\" Shaohao declared.\n\nXuen offered a simple challenge: \"Strike a single one of these monks, and you will have command of them all.\" Shaohao accepted. He swung Sheilun over and over again, but he struck nothing at all. The monks were too skilled. They easily evaded him.\n\nShaohao's humiliation and anger built up, and then they exploded. A great darkness burst forth from him, and in his rage, Shaohao broke Sheilun over his knee and lashed out with the power of the Sha of Anger. When he regained his senses, a monk lay dead, the victim of Shaohao's unchecked aggression.\n\nXuen watched the emperor's heart break for the life he had taken. And then Shaohao knelt humbly, accepting his failure, ridding himself of anger forever.\n\n\"Again I ask, why do you fight?\" Xuen said.\n\n\"For the people I protect,\" Shaohao replied. \"For them, I would give my final breath.\"\n\nShaohao was now ready to fulfill his destiny. He took one half of the broken staff and returned to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, prepared to save Pandaria.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Ten\n\nThe Legion had invaded to the north. A great battle was taking place at the Well of Eternity. And soon, very soon, it would end.\n\nShaohao returned to his people and tried to give them confidence, but there was none to be given. The Sundering was at hand, and its fury would change the face of Azeroth forever. There was nothing that could be done to stop it.\n\nAll Shaohao could do was shield them from annihilation. With Sheilun in his grasp, Shaohao committed his final breath to protecting his land and all who lived within it. This staff had saved countless lives before-and in one moment, it saved countless more.\n\nFree of all his burdens and negative emotions, Shaohao became one with the land. Through Sheilun, his spirit was transformed, surrounding Pandaria as a great mist.\n\nPandaria drifted away, immune to the chaos that gripped the rest of the world. The Sundering passed the land by, and for thousands of years, the mists would continue to protect Pandaria.\n\nBut although Shaohao disappeared that day, Sheilun remained.\n\nSheilun, Staff of the Mists, Part Eleven\n\nSheilun was found shortly after Shaohao's ascension. Monks brought it to the Terrace of Endless Spring for safekeeping, where it stayed for millennia.\n\nSeveral generations ago, a mistweaver master wrote at length about its history and meaning.\n\n\"It was not Sheilun that prompted Shaohao to make his sacrifice. It was not Sheilun that inspired Kang's revolution that freed his people. It was not Sheilun that kept the Serpent's Spine standing against countless mantid cycles. But it was there for all of those events, in the possession of people who could act. It is the perfect companion to those willing to sacrifice everything in order to save others. And I believe it has not yet found its final bearer.\"\n\n-Master Xunsu, Mistweaver of the Terrace of Endless Spring\n\nFists of the Heavens\n\nThe last thing Azeroth needed, on top of all its other problems, was to suffer another elemental invasion. It was good that you cut down Typhinius so quickly. Had he gone unopposed, he might have become truly unstoppable once he mastered these weapons.\n\nBut now the Fists of the Heavens are in your hands. You have a balanced heart; you seek harmony in all things. There is perhaps no other creature on Azeroth more capable of wielding this hurricane of power than you.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part One\n\nIt has not been long since Uldum was revealed to the world, and thus, many fragments of the tol'vir's history are still hidden from us. Still, it is becoming clear: the Fists of the Heavens are some of the finest weapons their society ever crafted. And they are also some of the most dangerous artifacts the world has ever seen.\n\nThere are tales of an ancient weaponsmith, a master without peer among the tol'vir. His name was Irmaat. His name is known to all surviving tol'vir as one of the most exceptional minds to have lived in Uldum... and also as a cautionary lesson. Irmaat was driven to create incredible works, but his pride turned out to be his undoing.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Two\n\nThe titans created the tol'vir to protect key locations across Azeroth. Over the millennia, some fell to the forces of darkness. For a very, very long time, Uldum did not. Irmaat, its weaponsmith, worked tirelessly to arm his brethren with the finest instruments possible.\n\nFor Irmaat, his work was not simply a duty. It was his calling. He saw his hands as extensions of the titans' will, and he wanted nothing less than to give his creations the ability to restore order to all chaos. He began to imbue his weapons with magic, using different sources of power to inspire him.\n\nThe power of air in particular held a special interest to him. He secretly observed the Skywall, the realm of air in the Elemental Plane, and studied the way its creatures lived and fought. Irmaat forged four scimitars, representing four extraordinary djinn lords. And then, in a ritual that stunned the tol'vir with its audacity, Irmaat summoned and bound those very four lords within the weapons themselves. Their power now belonged to the tol'vir.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Three\n\nIrmaat's four scimitars became highly coveted among tol'vir warriors. Stories of their power rapidly spread, and messengers came from other tol'vir outposts, begging Irmaat for more of those wonders.\n\nBut the weaponsmith's satisfaction was short-lived. He had accomplished something great, but it was not perfect. Irmaat had seen for himself the true elemental power of the Skywall. Even the captured might of four djinns was but a light breeze compared to the ultimate power of that realm.\n\nIrmaat carefully began crafting two new weapons. Not scimitars this time. Two smaller weapons, one to be held in each hand. He named them Al'burq and Alra'ed, and he intended for them to control a power that, by its nature, could never be tamed.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Four\n\nAfter Irmaat forged his new weapons, he declared them to be his finest work. These \"fists of the heavens\" would be capable of commanding the wind itself. All that was left was to capture the ultimate power within the Skywall: the elemental lord Al'Akir.\n\nIrmaat began the ritual slowly, not wanting to warn the Windlord of his plan. It took weeks of preparation, but once he was ready, it was over in an instant. The weaponsmith cast his spell, intending to open a portal to the Skywall and bind Al'Akir's essence. There was a great flash of light and a great rush of air, and when it was done, Irmaat could feel his weapons, Al'burq and Alra'ed, trembling with elemental power.\n\nHe believed he had succeeded. He believed he had accomplished the impossible. His surety was what led to his death.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Five\n\nOf all the elemental lords, Al'Akir was known to be the cleverest. When Irmaat captured four of his most prized lieutenants, the Windlord was filled with wrath, but he recognized an opportunity to exact vengeance. He suspected that Irmaat's pride would drive him onward.\n\nWhen Irmaat's spell concluded, he felt Al'Akir's power quivering. But it was not the elemental lord's spirit; it was Al'Akir's trap. When Irmaat hefted his two weapons and tested the power within them, uncontrollable fury spilled forth.\n\nThe weaponsmith, his forge, and a number of buildings within Uldum were destroyed by the hurricane of might that had been unleashed. The weapons themselves were hurled miles away. The unfortunate tol'vir who first tried to recover them were similarly destroyed. Al'Akir had made Irmaat's greatest creations unusable, filled with so much power that nobody could ever hope to control them.\n\nThe tol'vir carefully locked the weapons away, burying them deep. For millennia, nobody dared to touch them or repeat Irmaat's folly. Al'Akir's lesson had been learned very well.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Six\n\nThe events of the Cataclysm changed Azeroth forever.\n\nUldum was revealed to the world. The remnants of the tol'vir came under assault. Al'Akir and another elemental lord were slain by Azeroth's champions.\n\nWe have only begun to feel the ripple effects of those events. We do know that the death of Al'Akir left a power vacuum among the air elementals. His surviving subordinates went to war with one another, scrambling to secure leadership of the Skywall. None found any immediate advantage, for none were as powerful or as clever as their master had been.\n\nBut one djinn, Typhinius, sensed that there were still scraps of Al'Akir's power out there. The Fists of the Heavens would not stay buried for much longer.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Seven\n\nLingering rifts in the Skywall allowed Typhinius to leave quietly and hunt for something that would elevate him above his kin. He let his senses guide him and was led to an empty, nondescript part of the desert outside Uldum. When he dug into the sand, he found what the tol'vir had buried: the Fists of the Heavens, Irmaat's last creation.\n\nTyphinius realized that, though Al'Akir was dead, the weapons' elemental chaos remained--but it seemed to be slightly, just slightly, more stable than when the Windlord lived. Still, when the djinn first wielded the weapons, the resulting burst of power nearly destroyed him.\n\nBut slowly and secretly, Typhinius learned how to keep his old master's power under control.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Eight\n\nWhen Typhinius returned to the Skywall with the Fists of the Heavens in his grasp, he immediately set out to end the air elementals' civil war. It was not simply his raw power that quelled them. They sensed the essence of their old master, and it compelled them to obey.\n\nThere were those who refused, of course. Other djinns believed that they could band together and overcome Typhinius's borrowed strength. A huge battle nearly ripped apart the Vortex Pinnacle, and a brutal clash in the Temple of Asaad saw tremendous losses on all sides.\n\nIn the end, Typhinius was not the cleverest. He was simply the strongest, and he overpowered his enemies. He flung the spirits of those who had opposed him into the other elemental realms. Alone, they could not stop their natural enemies from finishing them off in a slow and agonizing fashion.\n\nTyphinius declared that he was the rightful heir to Al'Akir, and that he would finish what the Windlord had started.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Nine\n\nThe war in the Skywall had caused more damage than Typhinius realized. It would take time for the air elementals to regain their strength and prepare for a full offensive.\n\nTyphinius had no interest in waiting. The moment he felt the Burning Legion invade Azeroth, he knew that the mortal champions of the world would be preoccupied. He told his minions that there would be no better time.\n\nThe raids on Uldum began almost immediately. The Fists of the Heavens swept away all early resistance.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Ten\n\nTyphinius's assault on Uldum was a serious strategic error. The civil war had not long passed, and the fighting power of the air elementals was still weaker than it might have been only a few months later.\n\nThe only advantage they had were the weapons Al'burq and Alra'ed, but even Typhinius had not mastered their true potential yet. He could unleash carnage, yes, but most of his efforts had to be spent keeping Al'Akir's fury from ripping him apart.\n\nTyphinius's pride was fortunate for Azeroth. His ambition drew attention, and it was that attention that led to the discovery of his plans. He launched his war too soon, and even these weapons could not save him.\n\nFists of the Heavens, Part Eleven\n\nThe history of these weapons is marked with pride. The power that they contain can only be harnessed by a balanced mind and a harmonious spirit. Any arrogance, any cockiness, will inevitably lead to ruin for their wielders.\n\nBut if you are already practiced in walking with the wind... the Fists of the Heavens will finally have a master who can make them truly legendary.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on! There's more information to be uncovered in these texts, and time will bring it to the surface.\n\nCome back after further research has been completed and I will continue to record what I've discovered on this scroll.\n\n- Lorewalker Cho\n", "authors": ["Lorewalker Cho "]}, {"id": "15114", "title": "Words of Wind and Earth", "text": "Words of Wind and Earth\n\nAs recorded by Gorma of the Earthen Ring.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper's Ward\n\nThe mythical Highkeeper Ra bore two great items in his battles against the Old Gods. One was the Fist of Ra-den, a weapon infused with the destructive might of storms. The other was the Highkeeper's Ward, a shield pulsing with the primordial elements of fire, earth, air, and water.\n\nNo one has successfully wielded these armaments since they passed from Ra's care. Even Lei Shen, Thunder King and emperor of the mogu, could not. Will you succeed where he failed?\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part One\n\nIt is known that the titan Aman'Thul crafted the Fist of Ra-den. How he did so is another question.\n\nAccording to one legend, Aman'Thul called on mysterious celestial beings to forge an instrument that would hold sway over the power of storms. These creatures reached into Azeroth's sky and took a single bolt of lightning, which they shaped with their hands as if it were mere clay.\n\nWhen the craftsmen had finished their work, Aman'Thul encased the captured lightning in stone and branded the rock with titan runes of containment.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Two\n\nAman'Thul gave his lightning-infused weapon to Ra, one of the legendary titan-forged. These stone- and iron-skinned giants were created by the titans to liberate Azeroth from the Old Gods.\n\nThe Old Gods were immensely powerful, and their minions were beyond count. But never for a moment did Ra and his allies hesitate. Under the guidance of Aman'Thul and the other titans, the noble giants defeated the Old Gods and shackled them in prisons buried deep under the earth.\n\nRa accomplished many feats during this war. He wielded lightning with the lethal accuracy of a blade, carving through the Old Gods' servants and reducing them to cinders. There was only one enemy who matched Ra's command over storms: the cunning elemental lord known as Al'Akir.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Three\n\nFrom an ancient mogu legend detailing the battle fought by Ra and his allies against Al'Akir the Windlord:\n\n\"Master Ra and his brethren pursued the Windlord to a mountain so high it scraped the belly of the heavens. All the while, Al'Akir boasted of his coming victory, but his words were as empty as air.\n\n\"True, he was great and powerful. True, he could command the storms. But he did not breathe thunder and speak lightning as Master Ra did. He did not wield the fist that breaks the sky.\n\n\"Master Ra and his kin turned Al'Akir's own tempests against him until the Windlord faltered.\n\n\"To seal Al'Akir's demise, Master Ra slammed his fist into the mountaintop. The heavens split wide, and all the fire and fury they contained crashed down atop the Windlord's head.\"\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Four\n\nAn excerpt from The Banishing of the Elemental Lords, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"The elemental lords served as the Old Gods' greatest lieutenants, and the titan-forged had defeated them all. The victory was momentous, but it also presented a unique challenge. The spirits of the elemental lords were bound to Azeroth. If the titan-forged destroyed them, they would eventually manifest on the world again. To prevent this, Highkeeper Ra decided to imprison the destructive beings.\n\n\"He worked alongside the titan-forged sorceress Helya to create a pocket dimension that would be known as the Elemental Plane. It included four domains, representing the four elements: fire, air, earth, and water. Into this prison realm, Ra and Helya banished the elemental lords and almost all of their servants.\n\n\"Ra and Helya crafted a shield, the Highkeeper's Ward, to act as a key to the Elemental Plane. It thrummed with the energies of the four elements, which Ra could call upon whenever he desired.\"\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Five\n\nAfter the Old Gods were defeated, Ra and his allies created new kinds of titan-forged to protect and reshape Azeroth. Among them were the mighty stone-skinned mogu. Led by Ra, they journeyed to the southern reaches of the world and began their long guardianship.\n\nAman'Thul and his fellow titans closely watched these events unfold. Confident that Azeroth was safe in the hands of their servants, they eventually departed the world.\n\nOn a stormy day, Ra and his mogu followers ascended a colossal mountain to see the titans off. The legends say that the Highkeeper slammed his weapon against his shield, and the elements answered to his will. The rains ceased and the clouds parted. The mountain at their feet rose higher, and lightning and fire illuminated the skies so that Ra and his followers could better glimpse the titans.\n\nLastly, the winds howled a sorrowful farewell.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Six\n\nAn excerpt from The Rise of the Thunder King, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Many ages after the titans left Azeroth, a strange affliction called the curse of flesh took hold among the mogu. It weakened their stone forms and transformed them into creatures of flesh and blood.\n\n\"The mogu fragmented into warring clans. For years upon years, they fought each other for control of Azeroth's southern lands. From this crucible of violence, one mogu emerged and forged his people into an empire.\n\n\"His name was Lei Shen, the Thunder King, and his strength was without equal.\n\n\"Many tales exist about how Lei Shen acquired his power. The most widely accepted theory is that he stole it from a legendary being named Ra-den, which means \"Master Ra\" in the mogu tongue.\n\n\"But what of this creature's fabled artifacts, the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper's Ward? Surely, Lei Shen would have taken them as well, but there is very little mention of the Thunder King using them.\"\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Seven\n\nFor all his might, Lei Shen could not harness the energies of the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper's Ward. His inability to do so infuriated him. After all, Lei Shen had conquered the mogu and forged them into an empire. He had defeated Ra. How could two artifacts defy his will?\n\nBut defy him they did. The shield and the fist weapon were simply too much even for the Thunder King to control. Every time he tried to use the artifacts, elemental energies lashed out at Lei Shen and overwhelmed him.\n\nDespite these repeated failures, Lei Shen did not give up. One way or another, he would harness the power of these ancient weapons.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Eight\n\nLei Shen gave the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper's Ward to a gifted blacksmith, Forgemaster Deng. The Thunder King ordered him to unlock the artifacts' secrets, but he also warned the artisan not to harness their power for himself, or he would suffer grave consequences.\n\nDeng promised Lei Shen that he would follow his command, but he secretly plotted to disobey his master. The blacksmith reasoned that if he could find a way to use the weapon and the shield, something the Thunder King had been unable to do, he could take control over the mogu empire himself.\n\nWhile Deng was tampering with the Fist of Ra-den, a bolt of lightning tore down from the sky and slammed into him. The artifact absorbed most of the energy, which saved the blacksmith's life.\n\nBut Deng did not escape unharmed. The lightning left him forever disfigured.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Nine\n\nAfter much experimentation, Deng found a purpose for the Fist of Ra-den and the Highkeeper's Ward. He used the two artifacts to power an immense engine known as the Thunder Forge. This machine churned day and night, creating armaments of exceptional quality for the mogu military.\n\nLei Shen was pleased by the work, and he ordered Deng to personally craft him weapons and armor that would put all others to shame. The blacksmith toiled over the Thunder Forge to satisfy his master. Deng's labors gave rise to what would be his three greatest creations: a massive spear, a battleaxe, and a mighty helm.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Ten\n\nIn time, Deng and Lei Shen died. The mogu empire crumbled. Seasons passed. The world changed.\n\nA race known as the pandaren came to power in the lands once lorded over by the mogu. The new rulers governed with wisdom and benevolence, unlike Lei Shen and his brutal kin. Under the pandaren, an era of relative peace and prosperity settled over the region.\n\nThousands of years after the fall of the mogu empire, a group of pandaren guardians called the Shado-Pan discovered the artifacts that had powered the Thunder Forge. These explorers were led by Master Wan Snowdrift, who was unaware of the dangerous energies stored in the items he had found.\n\nSnowdrift took up the Fist of Ra-den, and he was immediately struck by a spear of lightning that seared his flesh and scarred his body.\n\nThe Fist of Ra-den, Part Eleven\n\nThough he was injured, Master Wan Snowdrift survived his encounter with the Fist of Ra-den. He and the other Shado-Pan feared that the weapon and its counterpart shield could do grave harm to the world if they fell into the wrong hands. To prevent this, they took the artifacts to Xuen, the White Tiger.\n\nThe White Tiger was one of the August Celestials, ancient and incredibly powerful creatures revered by the pandaren. Wise Xuen agreed with the Shado-Pan's assessment of the weapon and the shield. He secured them within his lair, the Temple of the White Tiger, where they would be safe.\n\nYet Xuen did not plan to keep them there forever. He knew the history of the artifacts. Though the mogu had used them for evil, the titan Aman'Thul had originally created them for good.\n\nXuen believed it was only a matter of time before a mortal arrived who was fit to wield the weapon and the shield for their intended purpose.\n\nDoomhammer\n\nForged in elemental fury, handed down from generation to generation, a harbinger of destruction to all who oppose it, the Doomhammer is prophesied to bring about both salvation and doom.\n\nSome of the most renowned orcs in history have possessed the Doomhammer: Blackhand, Orgrim, Thrall. And now it passes to you. In your hands, the Doomhammer carries the potential for either victory... or ruin.\n\nDoomhammer, Part One\n\nThe Doomhammer's origins have been traced to the ogre empire's rise to power on Draenor, and to an orc named Gelnar.\n\nIt is said that Gelnar, faced with the problem of preventing the orcs from being enslaved by the ogres, wandered alone in contemplation for days upon days. When a mighty storm forced him to take shelter in a Gorgrond steam cavern, Gelnar experienced fever-induced visions. Pledging his body and spirit to the elements, he submerged himself in a pool of lava and was miraculously unharmed.\n\nAccording to legend, the head of the Doomhammer was coaxed forth from the heart of Draenor itself. When Gelnar later crafted an oaken handle, the forming of the Doomhammer was complete. From that day forward, both the weapon and the name Doomhammer would be passed down from father to eldest son.\n\nDoomhammer, Part Two\n\nFrom the writings of Tolla Kol'gar, orc shaman:\n\n\"Our clan faced an army of ogre invaders.\n\n\"Gelnar raised the Doomhammer to the sky, and it spoke-it spoke in fire and lightning. Thunder rolled through the blackened clouds above, shaking the very ground beneath our feet. Draenor boomed with all its fury.\n\n\"Rain anointed us with the elements' blessing, and as Gelnar rushed toward the enemy, I knew that somehow our clan would survive.\n\n\"Emboldened and with a fierce war cry upon our lips, we charged forward to meet our fate.\"\n\nDoomhammer, Part Three\n\nThere is a long-standing prophecy associated with the Doomhammer: \"The last of the Doomhammer line will use it to bring first salvation and then doom to the orc people. Then it will pass into the hands of one who is not of the Blackrock clan; all will change again, and it will once again be used in the cause of justice.\"\n\nDoomhammer, Part Four\n\nFor generations, the Doomhammer was passed from father to eldest son upon the father's death. The chain was temporarily broken when a young Orgrim Doomhammer took the weapon to the lava pool where it had been created. There, he attempted to negate the prophecy associated with it, while retaining the hammer's power.\n\nThe pool reclaimed the weapon from Orgrim. It remained in the lava until an orc chieftain, clearing his mind of pride and dreams of glory, reached in and took the Doomhammer in his grasp. Though the lava left him permanently scarred, the chieftain did not die.\n\nFrom that day forward, that chieftain would be known as Blackhand.\n\nBlackhand used the Doomhammer to forge weapons and help fight off an invading ogre army. When the battle was complete, Blackhand returned the weapon to Orgrim, who would carry it until his death.\n\nDoomhammer, Part Five\n\nThroughout the First War between orcs and humans, Orgrim Doomhammer crushed enemies with the weapon of his namesake, blazing a path of destruction through one settlement after another.\n\nAs the war drew to a close, Orgrim used the Doomhammer to kill his commander, Blackhand, and claim the title of warchief of the Horde.\n\nDoomhammer in hand, Orgrim led the charge against the human capital of Stormwind, sacking it and winning a decisive victory for the orcs.\n\nDoomhammer, Part Six\n\nFrom the writings of General Turalyon, recounting the battle between Orgrim Doomhammer and Lord Anduin Lothar:\n\n\"I drove my way through friend and foe alike in an effort to reach the two combatants. A massive blow from Orgrim crumpled Lothar's shield, but our leader answered with a fierce strike of his own, nearly rending the orc commander's breastplate. Orgrim tore his armor free even as Lothar discarded his shield.\n\n\"The two re-engaged, trading vicious blows. Punishment and pain were dealt and endured. Orgrim punched, forcing Lord Lothar back; the orc followed with an overhead swing that our leader attempted to block, but before my horrified eyes, the massive hammer clove through the mighty blade of Stormwind, smashing down into the helm of our beloved commander.\n\n\"With his broken blade and his final breath, Lord Lothar opened a gash across the chest of Orgrim. Then, the Lion of Azeroth fell, his life's essence draining out onto the battlefield.\"\n\nDoomhammer, Part Seven\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second War, Orgrim Doomhammer went into hiding. It was his desire to liberate his fellow orcs from human internment camps, but he needed a strong ally. He would find that comrade in an orc raised by humans--Thrall.\n\nUpon first meeting the hooded Orgrim, Thrall was unaware of the stranger's identity. When Thrall challenged him to a fight at the camp of the Frostwolves, the former chieftain accepted.\n\nThrall quickly proved his mettle, trading blows with the armored combatant, grappling with him, and at one point, successfully wrenching the Doomhammer from the other orc's grasp.\n\nBy the end of the bout, Orgrim was so pleased with his opponent's tenacity that he named Thrall his second-in-command.\n\nDoomhammer, Part Eight\n\nAn account of the death of Orgrim Doomhammer, by Warchief Thrall:\n\n\"I was outraged! Orgrim lay there, dying, attacked from behind. The lance haft still protruded from his back. This was a cowardly act!\n\n\"I knelt beside him. 'My lord,' was all I could manage to say.\n\n\"My mentor then told me that I must carry on, that he had led the Horde once but it was not his destiny to do so again. At last he said, 'Yours is the title of warchief, Thrall, son of D-Durotan. You will wear my armor and carry my hammer.'\"\n\nDoomhammer, Part Nine\n\nWhen a dying Orgrim Doomhammer bequeathed his armor and hammer to Thrall, the young orc felt that he was unworthy of such an honor.\n\nOrgrim told Thrall that there was no one breathing who was worthier.\n\nThe last words of Orgrim Doomhammer to Thrall were, \"You will lead them... to victory... and you will lead them... to peace.\"\n\nOrgrim expired in Thrall's arms. To show that the orcs were not without a leader, Thrall took on the old warrior's armor. Once the plate mail was secured, Thrall bent down and picked up the Doomhammer--passed on not from father to son, but from mentor to student.\n\nDoomhammer, Part Ten\n\nOver many years, the appearance of the Doomhammer has changed, based on alterations made by its owners.\n\nIn the possession of Thrall, a Frostwolf symbol was added to the head of the hammer to honor his ancestral clan.\n\nThe newly modified Doomhammer quickly became an icon of strength and justice. Most importantly, though, it served as a symbol of hope for all orcs.\n\nDoomhammer, Part Eleven\n\nLong ago, before Orgrim passed the Doomhammer to Thrall, he confided that although the weapon had once brought him closer to the elements, over time it had become a dead weight in his hands.\n\nThrough the years, Thrall wielded the Doomhammer with honor and integrity. However, following his execution of the malign warchief Garrosh Hellscream, Thrall felt conflicted. This internal struggle was reflected in the Doomhammer as well. In Thrall's mind, the weapon that had embodied the ideals of justice and virtue had now come to represent vengeance.\n\nHistory repeated itself as the Doomhammer had once again become a \"dead weight.\" This has caused many to wonder whether the Doomhammer will reclaim its place as a symbol of righteous wrath.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides\n\nBy merely touching Sharas'dal, one can feel the weight of the world's oceans at their fingertips. This extraordinary scepter can command the rivers and the seas, and even manipulate life itself.\n\nJust like the tides, Sharas'dal's power can ebb and flow between acts of good and evil. Some have used the scepter to destroy, but its true potential lies in its ability to serve as a fount of healing and hope.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part One\n\nThe ancient night elf empire was one of the greatest mortal civilizations that ever spanned the lands of Azeroth. At its apex, one figure held sway over it all. Her name was Azshara. She was a leader of leaders, a queen of queens. Her power was absolute, and her thirst for knowledge and glory was unquenchable.\n\nOf the records that speak of Azshara, nearly all mention her bejeweled scepter called Sharas'dal. The legends claim it granted the queen command over the world's seas, among other miraculous feats. So cherished was this scepter that Azshara rarely let it out of her sight.\n\nIt was with her when she raised the night elf empire to new heights. And it was with her when she later brought the civilization crashing down in blood and fire.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Two\n\nAn excerpt from The Coronation of Queen Azshara:\n\n\"For days the coronation ceremony went on. Each night, the Highborne nobility lavished precious gifts on Azshara to curry her favor, but there was one she cherished more than all the others. A night elf named Lord Xavius presented the queen with a jeweled scepter, etched with delicate magical sigils. He promised Azshara that so long as she kept it close, it would bring her prosperity and great power.\n\n\"Azshara held the scepter aloft, and the jewels shimmered in the light of the moons like brilliant stars. The sight of the queen and her gift was so beautiful that it brought many of the attendant Highborne to tears.\"\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Three\n\nAt the heart of ancient Azeroth sat a massive lake of scintillating energy called the Well of Eternity. For decades, the night elves studied this fount of arcane magic, and they became learned sorcerers. Queen Azshara carried on this tradition, as did her loyal Highborne servitors. They devoted themselves to plumbing the Well of Eternity's depths in search of knowledge and power.\n\nPerhaps no one was more suited to this task than Azshara. She was one of the greatest magic users who had ever lived. As she honed her command over the lake's energies, she infused a drop of its living waters into her bejeweled scepter.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Four\n\nQueen Azshara's enchanted scepter afforded her great power. Imbued with the Well of Eternity's potent waters, it held sway over the rivers and the seas, aquatic creatures of all kinds, and the life energies that stirred within Azshara herself. She granted it a new name, one befitting its remarkable properties: Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides.\n\nOne of the first things Azshara did with Sharas'dal was use its power to enhance her legendary beauty. As the years wore on, the queen seemed to grow younger and more mesmerizing. A brilliant aura enveloped Azshara, enthralling those who looked upon her. The Highborne marveled at this strange phenomenon. A few even took it as a sign of divinity.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Five\n\nAn excerpt from Glory to the Queen Born of Stars:\n\n\"Of the wonders our queen brought to this world, perhaps none was so great as Lathar'Lazal. As masons constructed the temple, Azshara shaped the waters around it with the Scepter of Tides. She spoke the names of the rivers and the seas, and they moved at her command. Salt water from the roaring ocean and fresh water from the mountain streams trickled to Azshara's side. With the flick of her wrist, the queen partitioned them into great lakes that hugged Lathar'Lazal's sturdy foundation.\n\n\"Creatures of all kinds populated these waters, and they were at Azshara's beck and call. Whenever she walked the bridges of Lathar'Lazal, nearby schools of exotic fish would array themselves in colorful patterns. She even kept a colossal sea giant bound to one of the lakes. She used her scepter to make him perform tricks and feats of strength, much to the delight of the watching Highborne. Curious night elves from the far corners of the empire journeyed to Lathar'Lazal to study the mythical creature and his habits.\"\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Six\n\nAs the night elf empire stretched across the world, Azshara spent more and more time in her palace at the Well of Eternity's shores. She obsessed over the lake and used Sharas'dal to manipulate its mysterious energies. Azshara dreamed of making the world into a paradise--her paradise. But it would only be possible if she and her Highborne servitors could harness the Well of Eternity's true potential.\n\nTheir reckless experiments eventually sent arcane magic crashing through the Twisting Nether, the realm of demons. In time, the Burning Legion learned of the Well of Eternity and the world of Azeroth.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Seven\n\nAn excerpt from The War of the Ancients, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Azshara's obsession with remaking the world led her straight into the clutches of the Legion's ruler, Sargeras. The queen forged a pact with him for unfathomable power. All that Sargeras asked in return was for Azshara and her Highborne to summon his minions into Azeroth.\n\n\"It was a difficult request, even for such gifted sorcerers. Azshara and the Highborne approached the challenge with great fervor. Legends say the queen helped her servants open a gateway for the Legion's agents. She used Sharas'dal to gather the Well of Eternity's energies and fuel the Highborne's spellwork.\n\n\"Through this portal, the first armor-clad demons spilled into Azeroth. Many more would follow. The Legion would march across the land, spreading fire and death, bringing war and cataclysm.\"\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Eight\n\nThe War of the Ancients ended in catastrophe. Azshara's hubris and abuse of power would lead to the destruction of the Well of Eternity. The enormous lake buckled in upon itself, eventually igniting a monstrous explosion that shattered the world's surface.\n\nAzshara watched these events unfold from her broken palace. She refused to believe that her dreams of paradise were dead, that the world she had once cradled in her palms was coming apart beneath her feet. Many of the Highborne were just as delusional as the queen, and they remained at her side.\n\nAs the ocean roared in to fill the void left by the destroyed Well of Eternity, Azshara raised Sharas'dal high. She wove a magical shield around herself and the Highborne, saving them from being crushed by the colossal waves.\n\nBut it was only a momentary reprieve. The howling ocean soon swallowed the queen, Sharas'dal, and her followers.\n\nThen it sucked them down and down into darkness.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Nine\n\nFrom a fragmented text called The Song of Scales, author unknown:\n\n\"They drifted into the abyss, but Azshara and her Highborne remained unbroken.\n\n\"The darkness around them was absolute, and so the queen willed Sharas'dal to bring them light. It did.\n\n\"Azshara's and the Highborne's blood ran cold, and so the queen willed Sharas'dal to warm them. It did.\n\n\"Their lungs burned for air, and so the queen willed Sharas'dal to let them breathe the water... but it did not. The scepter could not save them. Oblivion spread its arms and beckoned the desperate Highborne.\n\n\"As the ocean crushed the life from their bodies, ancient creatures stirred in the darkness. Their whispers flowed through the currents. Their powers wrapped tight around the queen and her servants.\n\n\"The Highborne became something new. Something more.\n\n\"A fleece of scales shimmered over their skin. Tails thrashed against the currents. The unknown entities made the queen and her followers one with the sea... they made them into the naga.\"\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Ten\n\nThough Azshara's old empire was in ruins, she crafted a new one far from the light of the sun. The queen and her naga servants created a capital, Nazjatar, at the bottom of the sea. With patience and cunning, they expanded their dominion over the oceans. It is even said that Azshara nurtured an alliance with the mysterious and powerful entities who had transformed them into naga.\n\nAs the years wore on, Azshara relied on Sharas'dal less and less. She still treasured the scepter, but she found it was more useful in the hands of her fearsome sea witches. These loyal servants wielded Sharas'dal as a weapon to spread the naga's domain and crush all who opposed them.\n\nSharas'dal, Scepter of Tides, Part Eleven\n\nIt was not long before the naga sea witches learned to harness Sharas'dal as Azshara had. With a swipe of the scepter, they drove thousands of aquatic predators into a frenzy and unleashed them against troublesome sea giants. With a whispered incantation, they boiled Kvaldir raiders from the inside out and scattered their remains to the currents.\n\nWhen the sea witches were not wielding Sharas'dal, Azshara would often carry it at her side and reminisce about times long past. She still remembered Lord Xavius's promise: so long as she kept the scepter close, it would bring her prosperity and great power.\n\nThe queen had lost much, but she was not dead. Far from it. In her heart, she knew that one day her empire under the sea would eclipse even that of the ancient night elves. One day, the world would be hers again, and she would not let it slip through her fingers a second time.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nThe winds continue to speak, and the texts continue to have secrets to unfold.

It was his first rifle, and he designed it to harness the raw fury of storms.\n\nMimiron gave the weapon to his good friend, Keeper Thorim, to use in battle. Thorim was a legendary fighter who relished the hunt, and he wielded Titanstrike with great care and skill. No beast, no matter how mighty, could withstand the rifle's explosive power.\n\nWith you, Titanstrike has found someone worthy of carrying on Thorim's legacy.\n\nHunt wisely. Aim true.\n\nTitanstrike, Part One\n\nTitanstrike was not conceived by a mortal mind, nor was it crafted by mortal hands. This rifle traces its origins to a mirthful being named Mimiron. He was one of the keepers, a race of noble creatures who warred with the Old Gods and imprisoned the wicked entities beneath the earth.\n\nSome of Mimiron's fellow keepers could wield the fury of storms. Others were mighty warriors. Mimiron's strength was not physical but mental. His intellect and creativity had no equal.\n\nDay and night, Mimiron tinkered away at unique mechanisms. He was especially fond of experimenting with weapons that the keepers and their servants could use to protect Azeroth. When the earthen suggested that Mimiron make something that could strike at enemies from a distance, the keeper devoted himself to the challenge.\n\nBefore long, he developed the first firearm in history, a rifle known as Titanstrike.\n\nTitanstrike, Part Two\n\nMimiron's inventions rarely worked as intended. At least, not at first. He embraced the process of trial and error, often to the detriment of his faithful servants, the clockwork mechagnomes.\n\nWhile testing one of the earliest versions of Titanstrike, Mimiron set part of his workshop on fire and damaged over a dozen mechagnomes. The keeper learned a great deal from the disaster. After repairing his injured servants, Mimiron fine-tuned Titanstrike. He took the next prototype to a stormy mountain peak, a remote place where no one would be injured if the weapon went haywire.\n\nTitanstrike, Part Three\n\nMimiron's decision to test Titanstrike atop a mountain peak proved disastrous, but it was also illuminating. He had forged the newest version of the rifle with a mix of rare metal alloys that unintentionally attracted electricity. When Mimiron fired the weapon, a bolt of lightning leapt from a storm cloud and blasted Titanstrike into two pieces.\n\nMimiron wasn't angry or disappointed. He was ecstatic. The accident gave him an idea. The keeper would reassemble Titanstrike, and he would embrace its connection to the elements.\n\nHe would infuse it with the power of storms.\n\nTitanstrike, Part Four\n\nFrom chapter four of The Storm Thieves, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"Mimiron needed help to make his idea of Titanstrike a reality. He needed Keeper Thorim.\n\n\"Thorim commanded the crackling powers locked within the skies. His lair, the Temple of Storms, acted as a conduit for thunder and lightning. It would serve as the perfect forge to remake Titanstrike.\n\n\"One day, as an angry tempest churned over the temple, the two keepers went to work. Thorim wrestled with the winds and the lightning until they bent to his will. He gathered the storm, and all its fury, into a concentrated orb of energy called the Thunderspark, and then he bound it to his temple.\n\n\"Mimiron was ready. He channeled the Thunderspark into Titanstrike. Lightning rocked the temple before the keeper finally sealed the wrathful storm inside the rifle.\"\n\nTitanstrike, Part Five\n\nFrom chapter eleven of The Storm Thieves, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"The earthen have a legend of a time when 'the sky went mad.' It is said that thunder rolled through the heavens from distant corners of Azeroth for weeks on end. Most of the keepers thought something terrible had happened, that the sky itself had broken. But Mimiron ignored the sounds.\n\n\"Several keepers, led by Loken, followed the thunderous noise across the world. They finally tracked its source to an island far to the south, where monstrous devilsaurs and other scaled creatures roamed. There, the keepers discovered Thorim and his two worgs, Hati and Skoll, in the midst of a hunt.\n\n\"Loken hurried to the keeper's side to warn him of the sky's unrest. That was when he realized that Thorim himself was responsible for it.\n\n\"Thorim had received Titanstrike from Mimiron shortly after its creation, and he'd wasted no time using it in his favorite hunting grounds. His own energies amplified the rifle's explosive power. Every time he fired it, a thunderclap would split the heavens and rumble over the world.\"\n\nTitanstrike, Part Six\n\nFrom chapter twenty of The Storm Thieves, by the historian Evelyna:\n\n\"The only beast to escape Thorim and his worgs on their great hunts was a monstrous jormungar worm. The creature, covered in thick plates of white stone, was the largest of its kind ever to exist.\n\n\"When Thorim discovered the worm, he took aim with Titanstrike. His first shot cracked the jormungar's stone hide. Before he could fire again, his prey leapt forward and knocked Titanstrike from his grasp. Thorim pummeled the worm with his bare fists and forced it to burrow into the earth.\n\n\"So began a hunt that would last decades. Thorim and his worgs tracked the jormungar across the north, battling the worm whenever it emerged from the ground. In his last encounter with the beast, the keeper landed a shot between its armor plates. The jormungar fled, and it was never seen again.\"\n\nTitanstrike, Part Seven\n\nBetrayal eventually shattered the unity of the keepers. Most were imprisoned within their fortress of Ulduar. Thorim sank into depression and secluded himself in the Temple of Storms. Even hunting no longer made him happy, and he stored Titanstrike in his lair.\n\nAges passed, and the keepers' servants spread across the icy north. The vrykul formed clans and sought to dominate the land.\n\nA warrior named Volund yearned for more than that. He dreamed of lording over every vrykul. To do so, he searched for the powerful mechanisms and weapons crafted by the keepers. Volund's journeys would bring him to a lone mechagnome. The vrykul took the defenseless clockwork creature prisoner and forced him to reveal information about Mimiron's creations.\n\nFrom the mechagnome, Volund learned of Titanstrike and its location.\n\nTitanstrike, Part Eight\n\nFollowing Loken's betrayal, Thorim secluded himself in the Temple of Storms. He often drifted off into bouts of fitful sleep for years on end, while Hati and Skoll roamed the wilds as they pleased.\n\nVolund waited for one of these periods of slumber to steal Titanstrike. He ensnared a mighty proto-drake and used the beast to ascend to the Temple of Storms. Right under Thorim's nose, the bold vrykul pilfered Titanstrike and fled the keeper's lair.\n\nAfter Thorim awoke and discovered that Titanstrike was missing, he called Hati and Skoll to his side. The worgs and their master picked up Volund's trail and stormed after him. The vrykul narrowly stayed one step ahead of his pursuers, but he knew he could not do so forever. Thorim and his worgs were legendary hunters. They would eventually track down Volund and punish him.\n\nAlong with his captured mechagnome and the relics he had uncovered, Volund escaped the north. He journeyed far to the south, to a land he'd only heard stories of--a land known as Stormheim.\n\nTitanstrike, Part Nine\n\nFrom chapter three of The False Keeper, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Volund bragged of his might, and he demanded that Stormheim's vrykul follow his command. Of course, they did not obey him. Not yet. A few vrykul stepped forward to silence the arrogant newcomer. Volund felled them all with Titanstrike, each shot booming like a giant's footstep.\n\n\"When the vrykul witnessed Volund's power, they were in awe. He wielded the strength of the keepers, and therefore they believed he must have earned the mythical beings' favor.\n\n\"Volund declared himself warlord, and he rallied Stormheim's warriors under his banner. He and his army marched out from Stormheim to conquer the surrounding land for the glory of the vrykul.\"\n\nTitanstrike, Part Ten\n\nFrom chapter seven of The False Keeper, by the historian Llore:\n\n\"Warlord Volund had the strength of numbers and the weaponry needed to bring the lands around Stormheim to heel. What he lacked was unity.\n\n\"As the vrykul ranks made war against the mighty drogbar near Stormheim, Volund grew suspicious of his followers. He believed they were planning to murder him and take Titanstrike for themselves. After all, if he had stolen it from a keeper, surely someone could steal it from him.\n\n\"Volund's paranoia drove him to torture and execute many of his allies. The bulk of the vrykul soldiers abandoned the crazed warlord, and his once-formidable army crumbled.\"\n\nTitanstrike, Part Eleven\n\nMany years later, as Volund neared death, he ordered his enslaved mechagnome and his few remaining vrykul followers to bury him alongside Titanstrike. The warlord used the keeper-wrought mechanisms he had stolen as defensive wards to keep grave robbers out of his tomb. Even in death, Volund would let no one touch his cherished rifle.\n\nFortunately, Titanstrike did not remain buried beside the would-be conqueror forever. The rifle was not forged to spread terror or to dominate; it was forged to protect Azeroth.\n\nNow reclaimed, Mimiron's masterwork can fulfill its original purpose. It will strike wherever darkness stirs, and its thunderous report will herald the death of all who threaten the world or its people.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners\n\nIf only we could see the true glory of Quel'Thalas again. Thas'dorah was created to aid in the defense of the Highborne kingdom, but over the course of its storied history, the weapon became so much more. It has journeyed from Azeroth to the darkest corners of the Twisting Nether, and it has spilled the Burning Legion's blood on the demons' home territory.\n\nThe rightful owner of this bow is still missing. But Alleria Windrunner was stalwart and practical; she would insist that a worthy champion use it to strike fear in the Legion's heart once again.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part One\n\nNearly 7,000 years ago, the Highborne founded a new home in the Eastern Kingdoms. Their journey had been hard, and the land was hostile. But the end result was astonishing.\n\nThe elves built upon a confluence of magical ley lines and created a city, Silvermoon, near the Sunwell, a fount of pure arcane power. The kingdom of Quel'Thalas rose over the land as a shining monument to the glorious civilization that had once surrounded the shores of the Well of Eternity.\n\nAs the Sunwell's magic radiated outward through Eversong Woods, the forest's oldest tree began to absorb its energy. The massive tree was named Thas'alah, the \"Light of the Forest.\" From its enchanted branches, the entire region seemed to be bathed in the glow of an eternal spring.\n\nThis bow would be made from Thas'alah's wood, and it would bear the legacy of a Highborne family whose members showed heroism for thousands of years.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Two\n\nThe Highborne elves of Quel'Thalas had fended off constant attacks from Amani trolls. To keep their enemies at bay, they constructed a series of monolithic Runestones that acted as wards against intruders-and also hid the elves' use of arcane magic from the Burning Legion.\n\nThe wards succeeded in keeping their enemies out of Silvermoon, in part due to their anchor: the elven arcanists had linked the Runestones to Thas'alah, tying the power of natural magic to their arcane spells.\n\nHowever, the tree's power could not keep the Highborne safe when they left their city. For that, they needed skilled fighters.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Three\n\nThe Amani trolls were wary of launching direct attacks on Silvermoon. The elves' magic kept them at bay for several millennia, but eventually the trolls lashed out again. The conflict would become known as the Troll Wars, and the death toll rose quickly. An order of fighters called rangers was founded to defend Quel'Thalas.\n\nThe greatest of these early rangers was Talanas Windrunner, a master of archery and ranged combat. He swiftly rose in the ranks and was named the first ranger-general of Silvermoon for his bravery and valor. The leaders of Silvermoon commemorated the occasion by declaring that their champion be given a weapon befitting his new status.\n\nHighborne weaponsmiths set to work immediately.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Four\n\nA trio of skilled artisans joined together to create a great bow for Talanas. They carved its body from a limb taken from Thas'alah and infused the wood with the waters of the Sunwell.\n\nImmersed in arcane power, the bow began to change. It was hardened, becoming nearly indestructible, and yet it still maintained its connection to the natural magics of Thas'alah.\n\nWhen it was retrieved from the Sunwell, the bow radiated power. Talanas was humbled by the gift. He named the weapon Thas'dorah, \"Valor of the Forest.\"\n\nHe promised that, as long as this weapon protected Highborne lands, Silvermoon would never fall.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Five\n\nTalanas made good on his promise. Thas'dorah's power was so skillfully wrought that even a novice would have been able to hit a target from a hundred paces. In his hands, each arrow sang as it sailed to its mark.\n\nThe Amani trolls soon learned to fear the sight of his bow, for if they ever caught a glimpse of it, they were within its range. They were forced to retreat, allowing the Highborne elves to settle deeper into the forest.\n\nTalanas Windrunner became a legend for his part in securing the land of Quel'Thalas for future generations.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Six\n\nThas'dorah remained with the Windrunner bloodline for thousands of years. The family dedicated their lives to the defense of Quel'Thalas, and in each generation, one would carry the bow into the forests to drive away any interlopers.\n\nBecause Thas'dorah never left the region, it continued to bask in the radiant magic of the Sunwell and the surrounding forests. Slowly but surely, the bow was seasoned in a way no one could have anticipated.\n\nIts strength only increased. Its powers began to manifest in surprising ways. An arrow launched toward a target might be joined by other, magical arrows, also aimed at the enemy.\n\nEven after the Troll Wars drew to a close, Thas'dorah helped repel countless enemy incursions.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Seven\n\nA few years before the Horde invaded Azeroth, the ranger-general of Silvermoon was Lireesa Windrunner, who had three daughters: Alleria, Sylvanas, and Vereesa.\n\nAs the eldest, Alleria was to take on the mantle of ranger-general, but she had little use for tradition or expectations. She decided to apply her training to practical matters, so she became a Farstrider, a member of a group of rangers focused on fighting for the Highborne all across Azeroth. She made a name for herself after a number of quick, decisive victories. Her sister Sylvanas would one day rise to leadership in her stead.\n\nThas'dorah remained in Lireesa's hands. It would not be passed on to Alleria until tragedy struck.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Eight\n\nWhen the Horde invaded, most of the kingdoms of Azeroth did not believe it was a threat. After the orcs burned Stormwind to the ground, a few leaders took notice. The rulers of Silvermoon were reluctant to commit significant aid to the humans of Lordaeron, but Alleria thought that the demon-possessed orcs were a grave danger to the entire world. She led her group of rangers to Lordaeron-against orders-and fought at the Alliance's side with bravery.\n\nIt wasn't until the orcs allied with the Amani trolls and turned their attention to Quel'Thalas that the Highborne understood the true threat. Many elven rangers--including Lireesa Windrunner, the ranger-general--died in a bloody attack.\n\nSylvanas Windrunner would become the new ranger-general, but she passed Thas'dorah to her older sister Alleria. Sylvanas needed to help secure Quel'Thalas; she trusted that Alleria, a Farstrider, would have better opportunities to exact vengeance on the front lines.\n\nHer instincts proved correct. Alleria struck fear into orcs and trolls alike, bringing down countless enemies with her arrows.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Nine\n\nWhen the Second War ended, the orcs retreated to their homeworld of Draenor and rallied under a new warchief. Ner'zhul, the former chieftain of the Shadowmoon clan, promised that he would open portals to undiscovered worlds, ones ripe for plundering. The Alliance had no intention of letting him. Alleria volunteered to join the Alliance expedition as its lead scout. She carried Thas'dorah to Draenor with her.\n\nThe need for revenge still weighed heavy on her heart. It wasn't until she became close to a human, Turalyon, that she began to see a future beyond this war.\n\nThe Alliance expedition fought the Horde all across Draenor, but Ner'zhul succeeded in opening countless portals. The magical stress on the orcs' homeworld was so great that it was torn apart.\n\nThose among the Alliance who had not escaped through the Dark Portal, including Alleria and Turalyon, were presumed dead.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Ten\n\nWhen Thas'dorah was recovered from the Legion world of Niskara, it renewed hope that Alleria had survived the destruction of Draenor. Vereesa believed that her eldest sister had continued her war against evil by hunting the Burning Legion itself, pursuing it into the deepest recesses of the Twisting Nether.\n\nJust as Thas'dorah had absorbed power from its native realm, it had drunk deeply of the chaotic magics swirling through the Nether. Its arrows grew more potent, more accurate, and more lethal against the minions of the dark.\n\nThe bow became a symbol of the war against the Legion, a means to rally the greatest hunters of Azeroth against the demon horde.\n\nThas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners, Part Eleven\n\nQuel'Thalas is not what it once was. Thas'alah, the tree from which this bow was crafted, was cut down by the forces of Arthas Menethil. The citadel of Deatholme now stands atop its withered roots. The Highborne suffered massive losses at the hands of the Scourge, so much so that the few remaining survivors call themselves blood elves in remembrance of that tragedy.\n\nThis bow was crafted to protect innocents from evil. It has done so admirably, on this world and on countless others.\n\nNow it has been returned to Azeroth. Launched by one of the world's greatest champions, Thas'dorah's arrows will fly once more against evil.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods\n\nCrafted before the War of the Ancients, this spear has a unique tip, curved to resemble an eagle's beak, and it is infused with the energies of animal Ancients, or Wild Gods. Talonclaw has helped the tauren defend the world of Azeroth against all enemies, and it was passed to the greatest hunter of the Highmountain tribe until it was lost. Its wielder will be honored among the tauren, to whom it is legendary, but they will be hunted and reviled by the Legion.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part One\n\nLong before the War of the Ancients, tauren tribes roamed the sprawling wilds of ancient Kalimdor. The Highmountain tribe was led by Chieftain Moren Highmountain, who saved Ohn'ahra, a Wild God in the form of a giant eagle spirit, from an attack by fire elementals. In thanks, the eagle infused a portion of her essence into Moren's spear, gifting it with powerful magical abilities. Moren carved Ohn'ahra's name onto the haft of his weapon, which his people took to calling the Eagle Spear in her honor.\n\nTo commemorate other heroes he encountered, enemies he bested, and events he witnessed, Moren carved their names onto the Eagle Spear. As the spear was passed down to his descendants, they, too, carried on this tradition. In this way, the spear became a living history of the Highmountain tribe.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Two\n\nMoren's granddaughter Eruna was expected to become her tribe's leader. But before she could believe herself worthy of this responsibility, she took the Eagle Spear with her on a pilgrimage, a rite of passage to prove herself. In the northern lands, she rushed to defend a family of night elves from a cabal of tentacled beings issuing forth from a vast cave, wielding sinister magic--servants of the Old Gods who slumbered in dark places but were now awakening. She was joined in the struggle by a mighty bear, who revealed himself as an Ancient named Ursoc. Together, Eruna and Ursoc drove the strange creatures away.\n\nIn the aftermath of Eruna Highmountain's battle alongside Ursoc, the colossal bear took Eruna's measure and judged her worthy. Ursoc told her that a great darkness was coming and that the world would need strong warriors and leaders like her to face it. To aid her, he blessed her spear, adding his might to its enchanted power. In gratitude, Eruna carved Ursoc's name into the weapon, continuing the living story of the Eagle Spear, and returned to her people, ready to lead them.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Three\n\nLong after Eruna's passing, the spear was handed down to Huln Highmountain. Facing a devastating invasion from the Burning Legion, Huln unified other tauren tribes under his banner to join the night elves in fighting the demons.\n\nDuring one heated battle, Huln tried to protect the two-headed wolf Ancient, Omen, from the forces of the Legion, but the great beast was gravely wounded and poisoned with fel energy. Before he succumbed to demonic corruption, Omen gave his last breath of purity to the spear, adding to the powers that other Wild Gods had left therein. Huln placed the Ancient's name on his spear so that his courage would always be remembered.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Four\n\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Huln fought alongside many warriors who would go on to become legends in their own right. Among them was the night elf Jarod Shadowsong, who saved Huln's life from a demon attack in one of the last battles of the war. Huln carved their names into the Eagle Spear as well. He even crossed paths with the greatest of all druids, Malfurion Stormrage.\n\nFrom legends related by the elders of the Highmountain tribe:\"Huln handed the spear to the druid, who examined the weapon closely, remarking on the sharp, curved end fashioned to resemble the eagle's beak, and on all the names carved into the shaft by the tauren and his ancestors. Malfurion communed with the spirits within, and approved.\"\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Five\n\nTauren elders still tell that the doomlord Xyburn made it his personal mission to eradicate their race, and that Huln swore to kill him. The two bitter foes finally clashed during the battle for the Well of Eternity, and their fight ended only when Huln, seemingly beaten, landed a near-killing strike to Xyburn's face with his spear. The demon narrowly deflected the weapon, which, imbued with spirit powers, nonetheless struck him in the left eye, blinding him on that side.\n\nHuln won his battle, but before he could slay the doomlord, Xyburn--along with most of the demons in central Kalimdor--was expelled from Azeroth. Back in the Twisting Nether, he licked his wounds, awaiting the Legion's next campaign and vowing revenge on Huln, all tauren, and the weapon that had taken his sight. But there was no rest for Huln; shortly thereafter, the Well of Eternity imploded, creating massive earthquakes that tore through the world. As the land of Kalimdor shuddered and began to break apart, Huln and his people fled for their lives.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Six\n\nFollowing the War of the Ancients, the tauren tribes went their separate ways. With their ancestral land destroyed in the Great Sundering, Huln led his people on a quest to find a new home. They traveled far and saw many parts of the reshaped Azeroth before making their way to the Broken Isles, where they built the village of Thunder Totem in the shadow of the isles' tallest peak.\n\nHaving led his tribe to safety, Huln Highmountain bequeathed the Eagle Spear to his successor, and he went to join his ancestors. Legend has it that Ohn'ahra herself appeared to carry the spirit of the great chieftain into the sky.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Seven\n\nYears after the legendary Huln's passing, the Highmountain tribe found itself led by twin sisters, Arien and Gardrel. Although Arien was the greater warrior and had an affinity to the wilds, Gardrel was acknowledged to be wiser and a strong diplomat. Rather than divide the tribe or place its well-being in the wrong hands, the aging chieftain named Gardrel the new chieftain, and Arien became Protector of the Mountain, possessor of the Eagle Spear.\n\nThe sisters were happy with their roles, and Arien kept the tribe safe for many years, tapping into the blessings that the Wild Gods had bestowed on the weapon. She gave it the name Talonclaw, honoring the Wild Gods her ancestors had befriended.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Eight\n\nFrom the journal of Arien Highmountain, describing her tribe's encounter with an order of night elves called the Unseen Path:\n\n\"Gardrel and I led the night elves up the slopes of a nearby mountain. As we approached the summit, Talonclaw began to glow, emanating power. Instinctively, I held it up to the sky, and all were amazed--none more so than I--to see a cascade of golden energy pour from the spearhead and take the shape of a great eagle! But Gardrel and I remembered the lore of our tribe and realized that Ohn'ahra herself had blessed this site. At that very moment, we knew this sacred place should be renamed Talon Peak.\"\n\nIt was only with the help of the Highmountain tribe that the hunters of the Unseen Path--who had come to the Broken Isles specifically to guard against the Legion--were able to build their new home, Trueshot Lodge. From the trio of towers known as the Three Talons, they watched over the land and vowed to be ready should the Burning Legion return. The elves and the tauren learned much from each other, and Arien eventually joined the Unseen Path, becoming one of its greatest members.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Nine\n\nThe tradition of passing Talonclaw to the greatest hunter of the Highmountain tribe was carried on for many generations. If there were threats to the tribe or challenges to be conquered, the spear would be brought into battle.\n\nWhen word came that a mysterious beast was stalking the wilds of Stormheim, Nalmus Highmountain took up the spear and set out to tame the creature--or destroy it. The hunter was sent off with a great feast, and the epic \"Song of Talonclaw\" was sung to bring Nalmus success in his quest. All felt sure he would restore peace and calm to the land.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Ten\n\nWhen weeks passed without any word from Nalmus, a search party was dispatched. Though they looked far and wide, no trace of the famed hunter or his spear could be found, and several party members were lost to the unknown beast that prowled the mists.\n\nOver the years, many other brave hunters would set out to find the creature. Most were never heard from again, and the treasured spear had not been seen since Nalmus disappeared--until you, with the guidance and blessing of Ohn'ahra herself, recovered the legendary weapon. In so doing, you became a hunter whose name will long be remembered.\n\nTalonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods,Part Eleven\n\nWith the Spear of the Wild Gods in hand, you are a hunter with few equals in all of Azeroth. Your strength, agility, and fierceness are sure to give you the edge over nearly any prey--or any foe-you set your sights upon. And unlike other hunters with their rifles or bows, you--like Huln Highmountain--prefer to stand toe-to-toe with your enemies. You have perfected your trapping, hunting, and killing abilities on the ground, but now you have a unique appreciation for how it feels to strike like the great eagle Ohn'ahra. The spear enhances your survival skills, allowing you to become a true master of the wilds-and like the eagle, you need no help, for you have no peer.\n\nTalonclaw's spiritual power is such that shrines or temples that resonate with the force of the Wild Gods may respond to it, and priests of the Wild Gods may sense its presence. Its owner would be an honored guest in any tauren settlement (provided that they have not shown themselves to be an enemy of the tauren). On the other hand, the spear is also likely to draw the attention of the servants of chaos, so do not wield it carelessly.\n\nNote from the Author\n\nResearch efforts press on.

When he conjured water, it came out as mud. Hist attempts at arcane intellect made the subjects stuipder. Without any doubt, his tutors agreed that their pupil, Bungledorf, was the worst mage in Dalaran.\n\nBungledorf had come to learn with great hopes. He guzzled mana potions before class, mistakenly believing they would increase his skill. But all they ever increased was the number of times he accidentally burped during the important invocations, often setting classmates robes ablaze or turning his teacher's beard into sheep's wool in the process.\n\nAt his first exam, Bungledorf was asked to cast frost armor correctly. The other students shifted in their seats fearfully as he began the incantation. A blue fog encompassed the young lad and for a moment it looked as though he had succeeded.

The Maw of the Dammed is an exception. Its name is spoken with equal parts dread and awe among the Burning Legion's faithful. Even the demons disagree on how many lives the Maw of the Dammed has ended. There is only one who knows the truth. His name is Netrezaar, and his soul is bound to the blade itself.\n\nHe is what inspires fear in demons. They know of the eternal hunger that burns in his soul. A hunger so great it cannot distinguish between friend and foe. In the Legion's hands, Netrezaar's spirit consumed entire civilizations. In someone else's hands, he would not hesitate to do the same to the Legion. He would relish every moment.\n\nPART ONE\n\nDespite its long history of bloodshed, the Maw of the Dammed was not created for genocide. It was forged to take a single life: that of the great demon lord Kil'jaeden.\n\nKil'jaeden was one of the eredar race's most beloved leaders. With a mere word, he could sway the hearts and mind of his people. When he joined the demonic Burning Legion, many eredar blindly followed his path.\n\nOne of the first to do so was a gifted smith named Netrius. He adored Kil'jaeden, and he spent his life seeking the eredar leader's approval. Netrius was pledging himself to the Legion as the ultimate expression of his loyalty.\n\nAs a reward for his loyalty, Netrius was remade in the Legion's all-consuming fel fire. Volatile magics blazed through his soul, warping his mind and body forever.\n\nNetrius-now known by the name Netrezaar-was never the same again. Even his feelings toward Kil'jaeden changed. What was once admiration had twisted into a dangerous obsession. It wasn't enough to simply win Kil'jaeden's approval, he needed more.\n\nAn idea took shape in Netrezaar's mind. To satisfy his obsession, he would create a weapon to consume Kil'jaeden's life force. That weapon would one day become known as the Maw of the Dammed.\n\nPART TWO\n\nNetrezaar became a smith of much reown in the Burning Legion. His war machines terrorized worlds. His blades brought ruin to entire civilizations. Yet in truth, most of these weapons were merely experiments in his quest for the perfect tool with which to consume Kil'jaeden.\n\nSuccess hinged on finding a material that could draw out and contain the demon lord's life force. Netrezaar spent years searching for exotic ores, most of which proved useless.\n\nHe made a promising discovery on Nihilam, the Doom World. Long ago, a war between the Legion's ruler, Sargeras, and his fellow titans had shaken the fabric of creation around Nihilam. Their apocalyptic battle had darkened the world and infuse its metal ores with otherworldly properties.\n\nWhen Netrezaar mined these metals, he found them nearly indestructible. In just the right light, the materials reflected brief images of the battle fought between Sargeras and the titans. Most important of all, these metals also leeched away the essence of any living thing that touched them.\n\nFor the first time in years, Netrezaar felt joy. He had finally found what he needed.\n\nPART FOUR\n\nThe Maw of the Dammed's first victim was not Kil'jaeden. It was one of Netrezaar's servants.\n\nNetrezaar commanded dozen of mo'arg, highly resourceful demons who specialized in engineering and blacksmithing. All of them looked up to the eredar smith with awe, but he cared little for his followers. Like hammers and tongs, they were simply tools at his disposal.\n\nTo test the Maw, Netrezaar subjected a pair of mo'arg to gruesome experiments. He slowly cut their flesh with the axe, studying how quickly it drained their life forces. The Maw worked just as planned. The demons' vital energies passed through the blade and flooded into Netrezaar.\n\nPART FIVE\n\nOf the two mo'arg expiremented on by Netrezaar, one survived. His name was Gorelix, and he was the eredar smith's most devoted follower. At least, he had been. The experiments had left Gorelix shriveled and disfigured. His admiration for Netrezaar darkened into a hatred hotter than any demon forge.\n\nGorelix did not have the physical strength to rise against Netrezaar. Even if he could, rebelling would mean a fate worse than death. Netrezaar was one of the eredar-one of Kil'jaeden's chosen.\n\nThe broken mo'arg vowed to find another way to exact vengeance on his master. He watched Netrezaar's every movement, seeking a weakness. Over time, Gorelix discovered something odd. Netrezaar's axe was powerful, and yet he would not use it in battle. He kept it hidden from other demons, save his mo'arg servants. What was its purpose, if not to strike down the Legion's enemies?\n\nIt dawned on Gorelix that Netrezaar had no intention of ever using the axe for the Legion. He had crafted it for another purpose.\n\nPART SIX\n\nNetrezaar was pleased with the Maw, and he decided the time had come to use it on Kil'jaeden. He would present the axe as a gift to his master and then strike at the unsuspecting demon lord.\n\nPerhaps it would have worked, if not for Gorelix. When the mo'arg learned of the meeting with Kil'jaeden, the last puzzle piece slid into place. He finally realized the true purpose of Netrezaar's axe.\n\nHe warned Kil'jaeden of the impending betrayal, and the demon lord plotted his own in return. Kil'jaeden met with Netrezaar just as planned. But before the smith could present his \"gift,\" the demon lord struck. He used his magics to lock Netrezaar's spirit in place, while Gorelix took up the Maw.\n\nAs Netrezaar's screams of torment echoed over Argus, Gorelix slowly cut away his master's flesh. He did not stop until only bone remained.\n\nPART SEVEN\n\nNetrezaar's fate was worse than death. Kil'jaeden made sure of that. He locked Netrezaar's howling spirit within the smith's own skull. Then he ordered Gorelix to fuse the bone onto the Maw of the Damned.\n\nIn this way, Netrezaar would be one with his beloved axe forever. The weapon's metals would constantly drain his spirit, leaving him racked with hunger. No amount of life force would ever satisfy him. To the contrary, the more Netrezaar consumed, the worse his pangs of hunger would grow.\n\nKil'jaeden gifted the axe to Gorelix as a reward for his loyalty. He gave the mo'arg only one specific order: keep Netrezaar's spirit fed to continue his torture.\n\nPART EIGHT\n\nOn a small world under siege by the Legion, Gorelix learned of the Maw's true power and potential.\n\nHe and a team of mo'arg had been tasked with building a citadel to serve as a base of operations. In one battle, this stronghold came under attack from the world's brave defenders. A massive breach opened in the wall. If the mo'arg could not repair it soon, the entire citadel would fall to the Legion's enemies.\n\nGorelix volunteered to defend the breach while the other mo'arg worked. Hundreds of enemies stormed the opening in the wall, howling battle cries in their alien tongue. Gorelix stood fast, rending any who came within the Maw's deadly reach. He never flagged. On the contrary, every kill infused his body with greater strength and vitality.\n\nWhen the last attacker had fallen, the other mo'arg found that they no longer needed to repair the breach. Gorelix had filled it with corpses.\n\nPART NINE\n\nThe more Gorelix used the Maw, the more it changed him. He grew into a hulking mass of taut muscle, dwarling every other mo'arg in size. His monstrous appearance earned him a new name: the Fleshripper.\n\nDespite the power the Maw gave him, there were times when Gorelix did not use the axe. Sometimes he would watch from a distance while the Legion besieged new worlds. All the while, Gorelix would taunt Netrezaar's spirit, describing the battle and all the lives lost in great detail.\n\nWhen the Maw began to physically tremble in Gorelix's hands, he knew that Netrezaar's spirit was suffering. The mo'arg found as much satisfaction from these acts of torture as he did from imbibing the life force of his victims.\n\nPART TEN\n\nOn the world of Centralis, the Maw of the Damned secured its place as a weapon of legend.\n\nCentralis was home to a mighty warrior people. They resisted the Legion's attempts at conquest for much longer than other races. Yet like all who stood against the demons, they were doomed to fall eventually.\n\nRather than simply destroy Centralis's inhabitants, Kil'jaeden decided they would make fitting victims for the Maw of the Damned. Their potent life essence would engorge Netrezaar's spirit and push him to new realms of torment.\n\nAt Kil'jaeden's command, Gorelix traveled to Centralis. He marched at the head of a vast Legion army, Maw in hand. The blade bit through the armor, flesh, and souls of all who fell under his gaze. No corner of Centralis was safe from Gorelix's reach. No creature, not even the smallest wild beast, was shown mercy.\n\nWhen his long march had ended, only a dead world remained at his back.\n\nPART ELEVEN\n\nAfter the massacre of Centralis, Gorelix continued learning how to maximize the Maw's destructive power. So effective was he at wielding the axe that he became one of the Legion's most invaluable tools. Rather than waste Gorelix's talents in minor battles, Kil'jaeden saved the mo'arg for special tasks.\n\nThis also allowed Kil'jaeden to keep close watch over the Maw and its whereabouts. Though he trusted Gorelix, he could not bear the thought of the axe falling into enemy hands.\n\nWhile in Gorelix's care, the Maw claimed countless victims. No matter how much Netrezaar's spirit feasted, his wild screams continued echoing through the axe. Even demons began to fear the Maw and its cursed prisoner. They had seen the weapon consume entire races. An entire world. Yet still it wanted more.\n\nWhether Netrezaar's hunger will ever die is unknown.\n\nBLADES OF THE FALLEN PRINCE\n\nBefore Icebringer and Frostreaper, there was only Frostmourne. The name alone is enough to chill the hearts of the living. Few weapons have shaped as much of modern history as this one. Frostmourne spilled the blood of kings and destroyed nations. The scars it inflicted on the world remain to this day.\n\nIcebringer and Frostreaper will always carry this history with them, but they will not follow Frostmourne's path. They will make their own future. As one legacy ends, so another begins.\n\nPART ONE\n\nThe tales of Frostmourne were many, but they all trace back to the Lich King. The Burning Legion molded his spectral entity for one purpose: to spread a plague of undeath across Azeroth. Deep within the trackless wastes of Northrend, the Lich King began the dark task. His influence crept over the world like a shadow and manipulated mortal minds to serve him as agents of undeath.\n\nThe Lich King also possessed otherworldly artifacts to achieve his goal. Among them was the demon-forged runeblade Frostmourne. The weapon could consume the souls of its victims, imprisoning their spirits within the blade. It could also remake the living into madness undead servants. Yet to harness these extraordinary powers, the Lich King required a mortal vessel to wield Frostmourne.\n\nIn the young prince Arthas Menethil, he would find such a vessel.\n\nPART TWO\n\nLordaeron was the first region cripped by the plague of undeath. The affliction claimed entire families and villages as it tore through the human kingdom. These victims found no peace in death. They rose from the grave as mindless undead creatures called the Scourge.\n\nPrince Arthas Menethil vowed to stop these horrors at any cost. He undertook ever more extreme measures in pursuit of this goal. Eventually, against the wishes of his closest allies, he embarked on a reckless search for the plague's source to Northrend.\n\nThere, fate led him to Frostmourne. Though Arthas knew the runeblade was cursed, he believed he could use its powers for good. He was wrong. Upon taking up Frostmourne, Arthas succumbed to the Lich King's iron will. The prince's sanity unraveled, and the runeblade gorged on his soul.\n\nHe became the first of the Lich King's death knights.\n\nPART FOUR\n\nFrom chapter three of The Fall of Lordaeron and the Scouring of the Eastweald, written by Royal Historian Archesonus:\n\n\"Prince Arthas returned from Northrend to a hero's welcome. Bells tolled as the people of Lordaeron cheered their beloved prince. No one knew that he had lost his soul to Frostmourne. No one knew that he had slain his own soldiers in Northrend and converted them into undead.\n\n\"In the capital city's throne room, Arthas knelt before his father and liege, King Terenas II. It was to be a reunion of joy, but it ended in tragedy.\n\n\"The prince plunged Frostmourne through his father's heart. The blade drained Terenas's soul, as it would do to many others. With one stroke of the cursed weapon, Arthas destroyed more than a king. He destroyed an entire nation. All of Lordaeron soon fell to the dark prince and his Scourge.\"\n\nPART FIVE\n\nAs Arthas and the Scourge swept over Lordaeron, panic seized the living. Though many humans gave in to despair, some looked to the holy paladins for salvation. Uther the Lightbringer was the greatest of these righteous warriors. If anyone had the power to stop the fallen prince, it was him.\n\nIn the city of Andorhal, the two met in a battle that would decide Lordaeron's fate. Frostmourne clashed with Uther's legendary Hammer of the Lightbringer. Each weapon blow erupted in a shower of warring energies. It was a struggle between Light and darkness, between life and death.\n\nDeath prevailed. Frostmourne cleaved through Uther's gilded armor and devoured his virtuous soul. And with that, Arthas extinguised the last ray of hope that remained for Lordaeron's people.\n\nPART SIX\n\nThe list of Frostmourne's victims is long. Nearly everyone killed by the runeblade suffered the same dark fate. The weapon feasted on their broken souls and locked them within Frostmourne itself.\n\nRanger-General Sylvanas Windrunner was an exception. When the Scourge invaded the high elf kingdom of Quel'Thalas, she led a fierce resistance. Her brilliant tactics stymied Arthas and his unholy forces at every turn. She fought with the courage and valor of a true hero.\n\nWhen at last Sylvanas fell in battle, she did not receive the hero's death she deserved. Arthas punished the ranger-general for her stubborn opposition. He used Frostmourne to rip Sylvanas's soul from her body, and then he transformed her spirit into an incorporeal banshee.\n\nPART SEVEN\n\nThe death of the high elf king Anasterian Sunstrider, as recounted by Magister Hathorel:\n\n\"That rabid dog Arthas came to Quel'Thalas for one reason: to steal the power of our glorious Sunwell. We did everything to stop him. Everything. And still Arthas and his foul army marched on.\n\n\"It was in those final moments that our great king, Anasterian, appeared. He bore the legendary blade Felo'melorn. Dead and living alike stopped and watched as Anasterian dueled Arthas.\n\n\"Old though he was, my king held his own. He pushed Arthas to his limits. But even Felo'melorn was no match for Frostmourne. Arthas cleaved Anasterian's ancient blade in two. Then, with a single ruthless strike, the death knight ran my king through.\n\n\"I wanted to fight on, but I knew in my heart that it was all over. Everyone did.\"\n\nPART EIGHT\n\nNot even the mighty Sapphiron was safe from Frostmourne's bite. This wise blue dragon was a master of arcane magic and one of the greatest of his kind who had ever lived. For many ages, he and his loyal draconic servants stood guard over a trove of extraodinary relics in Northrend.\n\nIt was these relics that drew Arthas's attention to Sapphiron. The death knight and his Scourge minions invaded the dragon's lair to pilfer its treasures. The battle that followed would become one of legend.\n\nSapphiron and his fellow dragons unleashed the full fury of their arcane might on Arthas, but he would not be denied his prize. The death knight overwhelmed his ancient foes and slew them one by one. Calling on Frostmourne's powers, Arthas then transformed Sapphiron into an undead frost wyrm.\n\nIn his new form, Sapphiron would become one of the Scourge's most terrifying weapons.\n\nPART NINE\n\nFew crossed blades with Arthas and lived to tell the tale, but the demon Illidan Stormrage was one of them.\n\nWith a mighty army at his back, Illidan stormed across Northrend to destroy the Lich King. He advanced through sleet and snow toward Icecrown Citadel, frozen capital of the Scourge. Upon finally reaching his destination, Illidan found the death knight Arthas and the undead barring his way.\n\nAs living and dead waged war upon each other, Illidan and Arthas grappled in single combat.\n\nArmed with the mighty Warglaives of Azzinoth, Illidan assailed the death knight from all sides. The keening of their blades splintered the ice and shook the halls of the Lich King's citadel. Though evenly matched, Arthas gained the upper hand. Frostmourne tore through Illidan's flesh, nearly killing him.\n\nThe demon escaped with his life, but his wound would never truly heal. Years later, it would still ache from Frostmourne's icy touch.\n\nPART TEN\n\nWith Illidan defeated and his army routed, Arthas took the final step to seal his damnation. He became one with the Lich King, his mind and soul merging with the powerful spectral entity. In that moment, Arthas the death knight was no more. He became the avatar of death itself.\n\nArthas had bested all of his adversaries, and now his powers had increased by orders of magnitude. It seemed that none could stand against this new Lich King, but there was one who did. His name was Tirion Fordring, and he wielded a holy blade known as the Ashbringer.\n\nAt the Second Battle for Light's Hope Chapel, Tirion confronted Arthas and showed the world that he was not invincible. With a mighty blow from the Ashbringer, he forced the Scourge ruler to retreat.\n\nIt was not the last time Frostmourne would clash with the Ashbringer. When next the two blades met, only one would remain unbroken.\n\nPART ELEVEN\n\nNo king rules forever. Atop Icecrown Citadel, Arthas would learn that lesson.\n\nTo destroy the Lich King and his Scourge once and for all, Azeroth's nations launched a massive campaign into Northrend. The bloody war culminated in a siege on Icecrown Citadel itself. Armed with the Ashbringer, Tirion Fordring led some of the world's greatest champions deep into the stronghold.\n\nIn the frenzied assault that followed, Tirion once again met Arthas in battle. The Ashbringer crashed against Frostmourne, steel howling like a bitter winter wind. After a single bone-shaking strike, Tirion did what so many other great heroes had failed to do. He shattered Frostmourne. He ended Arthas's reign.\n\nThe breaking of Frostmourne unleashed many of the souls trapped within the runeblade. It also freed Arthas from the sword's domination. According to Tirion Fordring, the fallen prince's last words were:\n\n\"I see... only darkness... before me...\"\n\nAPOCALYPSE\n\nMost stories about the Burning Legion speak of countless demons stampeding over worlds, but the cunning nathrezim know that brute force is not only way to conquer an enemy. One lie can break an alliance. One drop of poison can cripple a giant. One disease can reduce a great city to a graveyard.\n\nThe nathrezim blade called Apocalypse has accomplished all of these things. It holds the power to spread plagues, incite wars, and turn ally against ally. In the right hands, this weapon has singlehandedly brought entire civilizations crashing down before the Legion's army ever began their invasion.\n\nPART ONE\n\nApocalypse was not crafted by a single nathrezim. Many of these demons forged and shaped the blade as a tool to hasten the fall of worlds.\n\nOver the course of centuries, Apocalypse passed from one nathrezim to another. Each wielder used it to weaken mortal civilizations and leave them vulnerable to conquest by the Burning Legion. Through the creation of plagues and famines, Apocalypse stoked the fires of paranoia. Through acts of murder and betrayal, the weapon drove the Legion's enemies to turn on each other. Even the mere sight of the blade was enough to sap the strength of mortals and cause them to tremble in fear.\n\nWhenever Apocalypse changed hands, its nathrezim owners would alter and refine it. Through the lessons learned from their conquests, they endowed the blade with new plagues and maledictions. In this way, Apocalypse became a fusion of all dark arts the nathrezim had at their disposal.\n\nPART TWO\n\nThe last of the nathrezim to wield Apocalypse was named Kathra'natir. The weapon passed to him during Legion's invasion of Navane. This world was home to a handful of intelligent races. Though they shared a history of enmity, they put aside their differences and united against the demons.\n\nThe alliance was tenuous at best, easy prey for Kathra'natir and Apocalypse.\n\nKathra'natir walked among Navane's resistance forces, disguised as one of their own soldiers. He whispered rumors of betrayal in every ear, inflaming old hatreds and ancient rivalries. All the while, Apocalypse clouded the defensers' ability to reason. They began to fear each other as much as the Legion. In one night of wanton bloodshed, Navane's army went to war with itself.\n\nKathra'natir admired his handiwork from a distance, listening of the symphony of chaos that filled the night. By sunrise, nor a single soldier remained to oppose the Legion.\n\nPART FOUR\n\nAn account of Apocalypse from the journal of Alodi, the first Guardian of Tirisfal:\n\n\"In the blade's presence, I am physically weakened. Strange thoughts swim through my mind. Dark things I will not repeat here. The weapon has a way of dregding up fears long forgotten and giving them new life. And these are just some of its tamer qualities.\n\n\"I have requested that we destroy the weapon, but the other council members have reservations. They would prefer we lock it away alongside other artifacts recovered from demons. It is not the ideal course, but so be it. If this council is to survive, it must do so through mutual trust and understanding.\n\n\"My only hope is that it never sees the light of day again.\"\n\nPART FIVE\n\nLong after Kathra'natir's defeat, Apocalypse resurfaced. It was a time of great turmoil for the Council of Tirisfal. The current Guardian, Aegwynn, had gone rogue. Seeing no other recourse, the council created a new order called the Tirisgarde to capture the troublesome Guardian.\n\nThe Tirisgarde armed themselves with mighty artifacts to overwhelm Aegwynn. They soon learned that artifacts alone were not enough to best a Guardian of her caliber. Aegwynn outwitted her hunters time and again. Out of desperation, the council finally unearthed Apocalypse and other closely guarded relics. They distributed these dangerous weapons to the most loyal and gifted Tirisgarde members.\n\nApocalypse was entrusted to Laith Sha'ol. From the very moment he held the blade, a darkness bloomed in his mind. It would continue to fester and swell until it consumed him entirely.\n\nPART SIX\n\nApocalypse granted Laith Sha'ol more power than he could have hoped for, but it came at a price. Hatred tainted his thoughts. His wish to see Aegwynn brought to justice became a wish to see her dead.\n\nLaith narrowly missed cornering his prey in the small human village of Corwell. He interrogated the townsfolk, accusing them of conspiring with Aegwynn. Though Corwell's people knew nothing of the Guardian's whereabouts, they succumbed to Apocalypse's influence. Before long, neighbor regarded neighbor with suspicion. Paranoia sank its poisoned fangs into the quaint village.\n\nIn a fit of rage, Laith cut down the town elder. The death ignited a wave of violence. Friends and family turned on each other with bare hands, teeth, and whatever else could serve as a weapon.\n\nOnly Laith walked out of that village alive.\n\nPART SEVEN\n\nFrom chapter eight of On Plagues, Curses, and Blights by Royal Historian Archesonus:\n\n\"There is an odd period of history during which we see an increase in disease, famine, and violence. The exact cause of these hardships is unknown. One interesting theory associates them with a nameless horseman who carried a sword of sinister origin.\n\n\"In some legends, this figure rode a pale horse. In others, a black mare with eyes aflame. Wherever the horseman passed, trouble followed. Crops withered. Diseases festered. Innocent folk simply dropped dead. For this reason, the horseman was known by many names: War, Death, Famine, and Pestilence.\n\n\"Did such an individual really exist? I think not. Attributing plagues and such to a physical entity was just a means for the people of the time to cope with phenomena beyond their control.\"\n\nPART EIGHT\n\nWhen Guardian Aegwynn learned of Laith Sha'ol and Apocalypse, she made a stand to spare the world from the demon-forged blade.\n\nAegwynn lured Laith into a trap, expecting to make short work of her adversary. She had underestimated Apocalypse's true strength. Laith unleashed the blade on the Guardian, draining her life force. None of Aegwynn's spells could shield her from Apocalypse's vampiric power. On the verge of collapse, she screamed a desperate incantation that shattered the connection between Laith and the sword.\n\nIn that moment, the darkness in Laith's mind vanished. He remembered everything he had done while under Apocalypse's influence. All the heartache. All the vile deeds. All the deaths.\n\nOvercome with horror, he dropped Apocalypse where he stood. Then he ran, and he never looked back.\n\nPART NINE\n\nAn account of Apocalypse's whereabouts from the Council of Tirisfal, author unknown:\n\n\"It is unclear where Laith Sha'ol disappeared to, or whether he is still alive. As for Apocalypse, Tirisgarde agents have reported that Aegwynn attempted to destroy the blade and neutralize its powers, but she failed to do so. She then took steps to seal the weapon away in a place where no one would find ti.\n\n\"There are a few prevailing theories about its current resting place. The first is that Aegwynn buried the sword at the site of her battle with Laith and shrouded it in a veil of magic. The second is that she encased the weapon in an arcane shell and cast it into the fiercy heart of Blackrock Mountain.\n\n\"Though it will take time, our agents will uncover the truth and reclaim the blade.\"\n\nPART TEN\n\nLaith Sha'ol never saw Apocalypse again. But in a cruel twist of fate, it would pass to his offspring.\n\nAfter his battle with Guardian Aegwynn, Laith settled in Stormwind City and started a family. He spent his days helping those in need as a way to atone for his past. His son, Ariden, did not live such an altruistic life.\n\nAriden traveled the lands of Stormwind with a group of dubious merchants. These grifters sold counterfeit elixirs and artifacts, swindling innocent folk out of their personal fortunes. When the merchants tried to sell their wares to Guardian Medivh in Karazhan, their luck changed.\n\nMedivh saw straight through their lies. To punish the merchants, the Guardian cursed them to act as his servants. Ariden and his fellow con artists became known as the Dark Riders. From that day forward, they would haunt the land, seeking out lost artifacts and bringing them to Karazhan.\n\nPART ELEVEN\n\nAriden knew nothing of Apocalypse's origins or its deadly powers. But due to his father's history with the weapon, he felt an unnatural pull toward it. The need to find Apocalypse burned within Ariden's soul, and he led the Dark Riders on a feverish search to uncover the mysterious artifact.\n\nThe Dark Riders scoured the lands of the Eastern Kingdoms before finally discovering the blade in the Badlands. Despite Aegwynn's efforts to hide Apocalypse, it had somehow surfaced again. Who had abandoned the weapon in this place, Ariden did not know. Nor did he care.\n\nAriden held the blade aloft, and the burning need within him finally subsided. In the years to come, he would pilfer many other artifacts, but none would ever exert the same pull on him as Apocalypse.\n\nNone would ever feel so strangely familiar.\n\nResearch efforts press on... there's more information to be uncovered in these texts.

After the trials of the past few weeks, we should take whatever blessings we can get.\n\nCeridwen keeps trying to get me to join her &quot;sister circle.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t like it. Every day that passes I see more and more girls about town wearing the wicker charm. At this pace, the whole town is going to join before I know it.\n\nAnd the men don&#39;t even seem to notice - they&#39;re even more oblivious than usual. It&#39;s almost as if they&#39;re under some sort of spell.\n\nThere has been a third disappearance this week. The guards insist there is nothing to be worried about, but I know better.\n\nI spoke with Mr. Knowlton just last night, and he saw the body of Jon the stablehand, who was the first to go missing. The image was burned in his brain, he said - profane markings covering the wall of his servant&#39;s shack, and his body sprawled on his cart, a gaping hole in his chest where his heart used to be.\n\nKnowlton is gone, now, and the guards are silent.\n\nI feel that Corlain is no longer safe for me and my family. Once we are able, we should relocate to Arom&#39;s Stand.\n\nTo whomever reads this - do not trust the sisterhood&#39;s magic!\n\nI don&#39;t know where they came from, but their circle grew in secret in the dark places of Corlain. Now, they have taken to the streets, killing all who stand in their way and hunting the others with their wicker abominations!\n\nNobody knows what they want. All they speak of is revenge for their master, and glory to their traitorous leader, &quot;The Mother.&quot;\n\nI don&#39;t think I will make it out of Corlain alive. I can only hope my words reach someone who can take action. Do not allow these &quot;sisters&quot; into your town!

Still, there was some knowledge to be gleaned from the tomes they were forced to leave behind as they escaped the Horde&#39;s aggression. References to the Old Gods are vague and oblique, existing only as archaeological footnotes from a time before the Sundering. Even the Shen&#39;dralar, adept in the arcane arts as they were, could not completely unravel the intricacies of the Black Empire&#39;s dark magic. Yet a few of them did dabble in the Void, and the lessons they learned grant me hope that N&#39;Zoth&#39;s own power can be wielded against him.\n\nEven in its abandoned state, the library&#39;s meticulous organization truly impressed me. If only more of it had remained intact. Such an extensive loss of wisdom is lamentable. The Shen&#39;dralar toiled ceaselessly to collect the librams that lined their bookshelves, only for the lion&#39;s share of it to be consumed by the flames of war.\n\nBut such is the nature of warfare, is it not? Seldom does it accomplish the intentions of its architects, and never without leaving immeasurable devastation in its wake... especially when the Horde and the Alliance are the forces in conflict. Can one ultimately say that victory is worth the price that must be paid to achieve it?\n\nPerhaps it is, in some cases. But the verdict is not as easily reached as I once thought.\n\nFor all the time I have spent in Pandaria, only recently did I make acquaintance with the Lorewalkers. The sheer volume of knowledge to be found within their scrolls was marvelous to behold. Lorewalker Cho taught me much about the legends of the Black Empire. He can be... shall we say... long-winded at times, but the wisdom he can impart upon those with the patience to listen is valuable indeed.\n\nThe Shado-Pan, in contrast, have little time for conversations not directly related to the defense of the pandaren. Their Omnia scholars have accumulated centuries of practical expertise in combatting the dark powers of the sha without succumbing to their influence. Given that the sha originated from the essence of Y&#39;Shaarj, the underlying principles of their techniques could prove effective in resisting the whispers of the Old Gods.\n\nI must admit, I felt a certain kinship with the Shado-Pan that I did not anticipate. The pandaren do not maintain a standing army, and so the Shado-Pan serve as their sole defense against both the mantid and the sha. Though they have trained themselves to seal away their emotions, there is an air of solitude about them that I recognize all too well. It is no easy task to stand alone against the darkness so that others may bask in the light.\n\nBut someone must always make that stand. And they can never allow themselves to falter.\n\nFew mysteries intrigue me more than the lost knowledge and technology left behind by the titans. The zeal with which I pursued their secrets in the past may have bordered on excess, but the quest in and of itself is one that must be continued. I know for certain that the Forge of Origination is the key to dealing the Old Gods their ultimate defeat, though I have not yet been able to discern the exact manner in which it is meant to be used.\n\nMy hope was that the Vault of Archavon would hold the answers I seek. Unfortunately, though the Vault contained much material for me to study, the giants who make it their home were... less than cordial to me upon my arrival. I cannot say I blame them, given their previous encounters with &quot;visitors&quot; from the Alliance and the Horde.\n\nIt is strange to think on how those events predate my own hatching. While I plumb the depths of forgotten lore from eons past, others have lived through crises I will only ever know from historical accounts. There must be someone on Azeroth who possesses the understanding I require, and perhaps my next course of action should be to seek them out.\n\nA pity the former Aspects are so reluctant to trust me. Even after all my research, their familiarity with the titans&#39; handiwork surely eclipses my own. But given the troubled history of my dragonflight... of Deathwing, Onyxia, Nefarian... and myself... I cannot say I blame them, either.\n\nIt is impossible to set eyes upon Karazhan without reflecting on the dark saga of its master. As befitting his title, the Last Guardian of Tirisfal had amassed a vast collection of writings and artifacts that dwarfs even that of the Kirin Tor. The insight I gained from the tower&#39;s library allowed me to reach a significant milestone: I have concocted a tonic that, when imbibed, will cleanse a minor amount of the Old Gods&#39; corruption and silence their whispers. Such is merely the first step on the path to defeating them once and for all, but it warrants celebration, nonetheless.\n\nThough I knew there were valuable lessons to learn in Karazhan, I did not anticipate that some of them would emerge from my conversations with Medivh&#39;s lingering spirit. He recounted his struggles under Sargeras&#39;s influence as the dark titan twisted his soul from within, and I was left to wonder if similar thoughts plagued Neltharion as he descended into madness himself. But Medivh also spoke of his spirit&#39;s return to the mortal realm, and how it guided Azeroth&#39;s champions in the fight against the very forces that once corrupted him. He said something on which I ruminate even now: &quot;I can never change the actions of my past,&quot; he told me, &quot;but I can forge a new legacy to leave behind.&quot;\n\nA new legacy. In the end, perhaps that is what I am truly after. A way to make amends for my father&#39;s failings... as well as my own. A legacy worthy of the black dragonflight&#39;s original sacred charge: the defense of Azeroth. The end of the Old Gods.\n\nI do hope these pages have proven to be of use to you, &lt;name&gt;.
