If so, they have led you here, and this place will keep you safe. I know what they meant for me, and I fear they have trapped me here.<br><br> I have extracted the previous entry after our conversation tonight. It can't have been easy for you, and I am sorry for all I've put you through in silence. I know while you do not love me, you did not mean any malice in what you did.<br><br> I knew about your plans to rob the casino with Dean before you told me. Hearing it from you didn't make it any easier. For what it's worth, I am glad you told me yourself, and I understood the tapes he had in his possession.<br><br> I do not think either one of you realized what your addiction stemmed from, however, and that is the tragedy in this. I suspect the world would not have believed you, regardless, so I respect your desire to keep it from others.<br><br> When first building this Villa, this casino, I meant it for you. As the world seemed to race headlong toward war, it became part of my desire to protect you. The loans, the funding I poured into the casino's construction...<br><br> I knew it would not matter when war came for us. It was my means of creating a shelter, a defense if the world was bombarded in radiation and bombs.<br><br> When Dean revealed his plans inadvertently through our introduction, I realized what had happened, and how I had been tricked. For a time, my thoughts were dark. I changed the casino vault from a shelter to a trap, as I knew the first one to enter would be Dean. He would die down here, and it would have been by his own hand.<br><br> I fear, however, that I overstepped myself, and the only safe place in the casino is the Vault. I have tried to rewire the systems, change the protocols, and I cannot. I will do one last check on the pipes by the edge of the outside platform and see if anything can be done. I fear it is useless.<br><br> If you come down here, do not access my personal accounts entry.<br><br> It contains only a message for Dean, and it will seal the door and you will have no way out - even the elevator is designed to automatically return when the door is closed, and it will lock in place.<br><br> There should be enough in the Vault to sustain you until help arrives. I have ensured that there is enough medical supplies down here to keep you comfortable.<br><br> The holograms should defend the casino from any attackers, and the hologram beacon in the Villa will broadcast an emergency signal so that others know you are here.<br><br> When danger has passed, rescue will come.<br><br> I hope you were able to read this, and know that I loved you.<br><br> Frederick Sinclair<br><br><strong> Sinclair's Personal Accounts.</strong><br><br> Warning : Private Access Only<br> Open Personal Logs?<br><br><strong>Yes</strong><br><br><br> Dean,<br><br> If you're reading this, this is goodbye.

When you finally pass away down here, either by your own hand or starvation, know that your greed has led you here, for no reason I can understand.<br><br> You have made a habit in using others for your own ends. Now, the Sierra Madre is your reward. Whether you used blackmail or force - or even played to Vera's greed, it will not help down here in the Vault. Greed has led you here.

Pretty quiet tonight, even from Puesta del Sol. Imagine Morris up in the casino probably has more than enough with the guests coming in tonight, poor bastard.<br><br> Set up the radios so I can listen in on the Gala Event when it fires up, and left one out for the prisoners.

Asked about items already in the Villa (didn't mention the construction crew) and he dismissed it.<br><br> Of course, no sooner than Sinclair gives his prohibition speech, his pal swings by the same hour, asking how \"hardnosed\" we were going to be. Told me he couldn't guarantee he could keep me supplied if I didn't treat his \"friends\" with the same respect. Prick.<br><br><strong> Security System Installation</strong><br><br> Sinclair installed a new security system for visitors coming into and out of the Villa - he doesn't seem to care too much about what they do when they're inside, only that we confiscate any personal items that could be dangerous or foreign, and make sure we know who enters and who leaves. Asked him again about watching the construction crews. He said that was a \"Villa matter\" (great, that means the Prick runs the show).

Unlike most everything else, we've had few problems with them. I heard they'd been part of some World's Fair exhibit Sinclair had seen, so he contacted the researchers about the dispensers to see if he could use them here.<br><br> Turns out, dispensers do more than supply convenience items: if there's an emergency or the threat of communist attack, codes can unlock ammo and repair kits for the dispensers.

Chief says he's not sure the chips were Sinclair's idea, only if we had any problems with the machines, let him know immediately.<br><br> <strong>Search and Seizure</strong><br><br> After another \"discussion\" with the Puesta del Sol crew, told Chief it'd be difficult to enforce the prohibition list, let alone the searches. Chief had the Gala on his brain, said Sinclair put construction of the Villa more important than patting down the construction crews for liquor and chems as long as they didn't hurt anyone or each other. Got a little hot under the collar, Chief did too, told me to walk it off.<br><br> This whole thing stinks. Chief's barely got time for me, now Sinclair's turning a blind eye to things in the Villa because his friend's running the show?<br><br><strong> No More Parking Tickets</strong><br><br> One good thing about this assignment - no more writing parking tickets. Sinclair's laid out the streets so narrow, cars can't even come into the Villa. Resources being what they are, he may not want folks to waste gas coming here. Cuts down on traffic noise, too.

While later versions will feature upgrades that allow for a 360 degree perception arc, the memory cells in current hologram emitters can only perceive their environment in a cone in front of them.<br><br> They can, however, change facing as needed and scan their environment for unauthorized activity. It is best to purchase security hologram emitters in pairs to cover a full view of the environment, as trespassers could conceivably use hologram blindspots to gain access to unauthorized areas!<br><br><strong>Hologram: Threat Detection 2.6</strong><br><br><br> If security holograms detect unauthorized guests or detect criminal action, they will display a warning \"caution\" color to the target.<br><br> If you believe they ever display this color in error, immediately move away from the hologram's field of view until they resume their normal protocol. If the behavior persists, they will enter engagement mode, turn red, and attempt to subdue targets with their discharge beams.<br><br> Note: As requested in the service contract, N.E. has installed EBE systems in all Sierra Madre security hologram emitters.<br><br><strong>Hologram: Threat Response 2.6.2</strong><br><br> Often, an intruder's natural response is to attack a security hologram, either with fists or with a weapon. Fortunately for the hologram owner, all such assaults are useless against security holograms! They cannot be wounded, damaged, or harmed unless their emitter is destroyed.<br><br> Attackers spending the time to look for emitters will usually be rendered unconscious by a hologram's discharge beams before they can disable them, so there is nothing to fear.<br><br><strong>Hologram: Security Protocols 2.7</strong><br><br> As with service holograms, security holograms cannot leave emitter range. They will pursue a target to the emitter's perimeter, however. This usually allows a target to be subdued, and should present no obstacle to casino security.<br><br><strong>Hologram: Hologram Emitters 5.0</strong><br><br> Hologram emitters are sturdy, yet can still be damaged or broken if enough force is applied. In addition, while they are protected inside sturdy space age alloys, their circuits are vulnerable to being tampered with.

Do not attempt to repair the emitter yourself!<br><br> Warning: Do not approach an emitter that may have been tampered with!

The deck may have any number of cards of any type that suits a player&#39;s strategy, although it cannot have duplicate cards from the same set. For example, a King of Spades from Set A and a King of Spades from the Set B deck is acceptable, but more than one King of Spades from Set A would be illegal.\n\nRULES\n\nCaravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or &quot;caravans&quot;) of numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent&#39;s caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).\n\nThe game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.\n\nOnce both players have started their three caravans, each player may do ONE of the following on their turn:\n\n1. Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand.\n\n2. Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck.\n\n3. Disband one of their three caravans by removing all cards from that pile.\n\nCaravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and affects them in various ways.\n\nCARD VALUES\n\nJoker: Played against ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it&#39;s an ace or a numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.\n\nAce: Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace&#39;s suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an Ace of Spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.\n\n2-10: Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of Hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.\n\nJack: Played against ace, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.\n\nQueen: Played against ace, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand and changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.\n\nKing: Played against ace, 2-10. Adds the value of that card again. E.g. a king played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand. Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects. E.g. 4+ king = 8. 4 + 2 kings = 16.\n\nWINNING\n\nA player&#39;s caravan is considered sold when the value of its cards is over 20 and under 27. The other player may still outbid by increasing the value of their opposing pile while staying within the 21-26 range. When each of the three competing caravans has sold, the game is over.

Each year it is the appointed task of the ombudsman not only to officiate the election, but to chronicle it in hopes that after the last overseer has finished his term and walked to his death in the chamber beneath his office, and the vault has become still, that one day some excavator from humanity or perhaps some yet-unknown race of super beings might find our records and incorporate them into historical canon.\n\nBut lately it&#39;s occurred to me that that&#39;s not really why. I think the real reason we do it is because we want to believe that somewhere in the archives there&#39;s an answer to all of this, or perhaps there will be one when the historical records are completed and the whole story is told. We want it to make sense. To understand why the vault&#39;s mainframe will kill us if we do not offer one of our own as a yearly sacrifice. To fully comprehend why we continue to have these elections despite the unfettered corruption that has plagued it for what must be decades by now. There was a simpler time when elections meant shaking hands and kissing babies. But now with the rise of the voting blocs and this infestation of bribery, drug trafficking, smuggling, and God knows what else, we want to know why.\n\nWell I&#39;ve been through the archives, and I can tell you you won&#39;t find the answer there. You&#39;ll find an account of the first overseer, who entered the vault as the only citizen aware of the sacrifices that would have to take place. But he didn&#39;t have the answers either. If he did, surely he would&#39;ve foreseen the citizens&#39; anger when he broke the news. Surely he would&#39;ve guessed that they would want to choose a sacrifice democratically, in the way that we citizens are accustomed to washing our hands of terrible deeds, and that his name would be at the top of the polls, and that the simultaneous vacancy of overseer and martyr would forever fuse the two positions here in Vault 11. But he didn&#39;t. He had the answers no more than any of us, and the records state that after the citizens discovered that the sacrificial chamber&#39;s password was his wife Betty&#39;s first name, and its door was unsealed so he could be offered as the first sacrifice, he walked down into that room crying like a child.\n\nI can only wonder if there are no answers to be found, and we are just going along with this because we don&#39;t see another choice. Nevertheless, I still hold onto hope that we can find one.

The probability of an equally capable figure emerging from the current human population to lead mankind to a future of equivalent quality is less than 0.000112% by objective measures too complex to detail in this obituary.\n\nPersonality and force of will: Born June 25th, 2020, House was orphaned at an early age when his parents died in a freak accident (auto gyro, lightning). Though cheated of his inheritance, House attended the prestigious Institute in Massachusetts and founded RobCo Industries on his 22nd birthday. Within five years, it was one of the most profitable corporations on Earth.\n\nVision: By 2065, House was certain that an atomic war would soon devastate the planet. At great personal expense, he developed technologies to ensure the structural integrity of the city of Las Vegas (as it was known at the time). On the day of the great war, 77 atomic warheads targeted the city. Mr. House defeated them all. Talk about vision!\n\nLeadership: Mr. House survived the war, of course, and would later recruit the Three Families, negotiate the Treaty of New Vegas, and rebuild the Vegas Strip. While these achievements yielded many immediate benefits, they were all part of House&#39;s master plan to re-ignite mankind&#39;s quest for technological advancement, a plan without which the human race has nowhere to go, and nowhere to turn.\n\n/// Will revise and finish this up later.

The Chryslus too, but no sign of the old couple's bones.<br><br><br> Outside Nephi I caught a trail. Three men, tracks heading toward Fountain Green. Thought about following but didn't. Stupid fantasy of friends, more likely cannibals.<br><br><br> June 20th<br> Took two days to build door and electrify it.<br><br><br> No soliciting, assholes. Home sweet fucking home.<br><br><br><strong>Year 2095</strong><br><br><br><br><br> September 20th<br> I count 28 of them. 11 adult males, 8 females, 9 children aged 2 - 10. Some rifles and pistols in bad repair. Old world clothes, ratty.<br><br><br> September 22nd<br> Got close enough last night to hear them talk. Spanish, I think. From Mexico?<br><br><br> Heard them say \"paradeeso\" a bunch. Think that means paradise. Here to stay, then.<br><br><br> Seem harmless. SEEM.<br><br><br> October 5th<br> The one I call \"Maria\" is pregnant. Think the father is \"Jose\" but she spends a lot of time with \"Pablo\" too.<br><br><br> October 7th<br> \"Pedro\" ran out to pee in the stream and would've seen me if he looked to his left. Too close. Need to give them space.<br><br><br> November 10th<br> \"Jose\" broke his leg chasing a bighorn. Too far from camp for them to hear. Told myself to leave it be but couldn't. 300 yards from their camp did my best Jose screaming imitation until a bunch of them came looking, then strung them along to the crest where they could hear the real Jose.<br><br><br> Probably useless. Compound fracture, broke the skin.<br><br><br> November 11th<br> \"Infec-shee-own.\" So many goddamn words nearly the same, think I'd be fluent. But anyway Jose's leg has got it so he's going to die. Nature for you. Of course they're giving prayer a try.<br><br><br> November 12th<br> Left bottle of antibiotics on a rock outside their camp last night. They thanked God (Dee-os) of course. As though that asshole saw fit to burn the world but still cared enough to leave some medicine on a rock.<br><br><br> November 15th<br> Jose will always limp but otherwise he'll be okay. Good deed for the month.<br><br><br> Will they make it through the winter?<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Year 2096</strong><br><h1><br></h1>February 11th<br> Fuckers killed all the men. I think they would've taken the women alive but Maria and Selena opened fire and some of the others went for their guns so they shot them down and some of the kids with them.<br><br><br> If I could've warned them.<br><br><br> February 12th<br> Elena and Carmen and 5 children still alive, being kept in a pen.<br><br><br> There are more than 100 of these assholes in blue suits. Every suit says \"22\" on the back. Why? Armed to the teeth with submachine guns, pistols. Estimate 60% male. Everyone seems to follow the dark-haired guy but can't get close enough to tell. Assholes are disciplined - patrols, sentries - they mean business.<br><br><br> Say I go in at night and get the women and children out. Where to next?<br><br><br> But I have to get them out. Have to.<br><br><br> February 13th<br> Recon during night.<br><br><br> Well-organized, sentries along most approaches, but stream not covered.<br><br><br> Are they sick? Lots of coughing fits. Tuberculosis?<br><br><br> Women and children still in pen. Will try to infiltrate by stream tomorrow night.<br><br><br> February 14th<br> They ate them.<br><br><br> February 19th<br> Ambush along riverside trail. 6 males killed. Heard their coughing a mile away.<br><br><br> Used their grenades to booby-trap bodies, kept half. Secured 6 SMGs, 500 rounds 10mm, 6 frags.<br><br><br> February 20th<br> Ambush along riverside trail. 2 males died checking bodies. Killed 2 more with rifle. Shot 1 through calf and let asshole crawl off to spread message. Coughed like I'd shot him through lungs.<br><br><br> February 23rd<br> Ambush half-mile east of coal pits wash. 8 males killed.<br><br><br> February 28th<br> Ambush in the narrows. 6 males killed. Took a 10mm through thigh, steel jacket, missed femoral. Lucky. Used tourniquet to make sure no blood spattered on rocks back to cave. Have set traps all along entrance passage but if they find me it will be matter of time. Still, 24 confirmed kills in 10 days = at least 1/3rd of their combat force, not bad for an old man.<br><br><br> March 2nd<br> Lucky lucky lucky lucky. Patrol was small - 3 men. Screaming woke me - point man caught under deadfall. Panic fire ricocheted into the cave, almost hit me. Crawled forward and killed them all with SMGs. Nearly used frags, stupid, finger in pin when remembered ricochets.<br><br><br> Leaving at once. No other patrols in area but they'll be searching narrows for these 3. Taking as much food as I can drag with me and heading to cave south.<br><br><br><strong>Year 2097</strong><br><br><br> January 13th<br> The Coughers are gone finally. All 34 that still lived. Ate their dead for strength, then struck out SE.<br><br><br> Victory. 10 months of killing. All I feel is cold.<br><br><br> They deserved every goddamn bit of it.<br><br><br> January 17th<br> Thought I was dreaming but the screams were real. For a moment thought they'd tricked me, just pretended to leave Zion, then sent a patrol to track me down. But the screams were a woman's.<br><br><br> Edged around corner in passageway to have a look. One Vaulter, ankle deep in bear trap. Leveled my SMG but the way she was crying stopped me.<br><br><br> How she screamed when she saw me. Been their boogey man a long time.<br><br><br> Name's Sylvie. Claims she ran away from them. Calls them evil people, \"children of the devil\". Turns out they were sick after all, something they caught in a Vault they lived in. She never came down with it (yet).<br><br><br> So help me, I've wound up being her nurse.<br><br><br> January 18th<br> Her story matches what I learned from my \"interrogations\" last year, but according to her - let's just say it was bad to be a woman in that group. So when they left, she slipped away.<br><br><br> She knows next to nothing about living outside a Vault. Says she wants to learn.<br><br><br><strong>Year 2100</strong><br><br><br> September 9th<br> Never been so scared in my life.<br><br><br> Canada wasn't scary, just sickening, the criminality of it.<br><br><br> The end of the world wasn't scary. When I knew you and Alex were dead, I didn't have anything left to be scared about. I just went on for some reason.<br><br><br> I wasn't scared fighting the Vaulters. It was like I kept daring them to finish me. When I killed them, I think it was the closest I came to being happy in years<br><br><br> Sylvie is pregnant. And I am terrified.<br><br><br> Ridiculous old man. A father again at 47. In this world?<br><br><br> She's so excited and so - trusting. Says it's God's will that we have this child. Like nothing can go wrong.<br><br><br> You see, Char, she doesn't know about you and Alex. Never told her. Almost did sometimes but what you and I had, it seemed wrong to share it.<br><br><br> More like an old man not wanting his young wife to know how he failed the one who come before her.<br><br><br> Hiking into Toquerville for medical books and supplies. This will be done right.<br><br><br> I'm sorry, Char. Hope you can forgive me.<br><br><br><strong>Year 2101</strong><br><br><br> March 5th<br> Baby was breech. Would've been a son. Michael.<br><br><br> Did my best to turn him. Failed. Must've done Caesarian too late. Had to put Sylvie out and she never woke up.<br><br><br> Buried them south of the Narrows. Well.

Goddammit they are real.<br><br><br> Rushed me the moment they saw me, snarling like animals. They look like corpses but don't smell rotted.<br><br><br> I'll be putting them out of their misery. Doing for them what I never could for myself.<br><br><br> September 3rd<br> The last of them. All gone.<br><br><br><strong>Year 2113</strong><br><br><br> February 5th<br> Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday you useless old dinosaur, happy birthday to me.<br><br><br> Happy 60th.

What do I have to do to prove to myself that I've lived long enough?<br><br><br> I'm a shriveled old man. White beard. Seen enough sunrises and sunsets. Saw the big sunset, been hanging on through the long night 36 years now. Ridiculous.<br><br><br> Not kidding myself into thinking there's anything on the other side of this. Fine. Things weren't so bad before I was born.<br><br><br> Char and Alex. Sylvie and Michael-who-could've-been.<br><br><br> Thoughts of the beloved dead before dying.<br><br><br> Goodbye, Zion.<br><br><br> February 6th<br> Fucking didn't do it, coward as usual.

Dirty and scrawny, been on foot a long time. Children's crusade.<br><br><br> Struck camp on nearly the same spot as los mexicanos, 30 years and a lifetime ago.<br><br><br> I've spent 2 nights listening to them. English. Literate. One of them reads stories while the little ones fall asleep.<br><br><br> They escaped someplace they call \"The School\" but can't figure out where it was. When they want little one to behave they tell him to stop or \"The Principal will get you.\"<br><br><br> Principal better not show up or I'll blow his goddamn head off. I can still shoot straight.<br><br><br><strong>Year 2124</strong><br><br><br> January 2nd<br> I've been leaving notes for them, and gifts.<br><br><br> They like the books. Started with stories but moved on to weapons manuals, medical books, practical stuff.<br><br><br> In the notes, well it's embarrassing, almost like those cards people used to give each other, everything sweet and loving. I tell them to read and to learn and to make the most of their new home. I tell them I'm giving them Zion as a gift to make up for all the sorrows of their lives so far and all the sorrows man has visited on man. I tell them to be kind to each other and modest. I tell them never to hurt each other but that if someone else comes along and tries to hurt them to strike back with righteous anger. Stuff like that. I sign every note \"The Father\", because well, just because.<br><br><br> January 18th<br> Have I mentioned that I'm dying?<br><br><br> Mind's still sharp. Lungs are the problem. Might be cancer. Cough's been getting worse for months, finally there's blood in it. Getting harder to visit my little friends, breath's so short.<br><br><br> I've given away most of what I own. They'll find the rest in caves when they get a little older. I don't want them to find me, though. \"The Father\" is a broken-down old man? Disappointment.<br><br><br> It's time. I don't want another birthday.<br><br><br> January 23rd<br> It's cold enough that I won't last long on the high mound up next to Red Gate. I think I've got enough breath left in me to make it. I'll just lie down and stare at the sky. Feels right.<br><br><br> I hope they'll do well. I hope no harm comes to them, from within or without. Did my best to prepare them with the last notes. Said something kind about each one of them, what makes each one special. Told them \"The Father\" was pleased by their kind natures and that it would be up to them to handle things on their own from now on, that I'd be silent but still watching and still caring.<br><br><br> Lying, then. Oh yes.<br><br><br> Lied to you, Char. And Alex. And Sylvie. Told you I'd be with you forever. But I wouldn't go back and unsay it once if I could.<br><br><br> What was the point of it all? So many failures.<br><br><br> But I never forgot your face. Or Little Nut's. Or (sorry) Sylvie's. They used to say that happened after a while but it never did for me.<br><br><br> Maybe the only point of all that living was to keep those pictures in my head going for as long as I could. It was the only life I could give you. Not a day went by without.<br><br><br> It wasn't choice. I chose to die again and again. Just never did. Body had its own drive.<br><br><br> Well, the little ones will need it. Species will need it if it's to continue. That blind drive onward.<br><br><br> I wish them well.

Left with answers I never intended.\"<br><br><strong>Ulysses Log Y-17.17</strong><br><br><br> \"Have you ever wanted to speak to history - just to know the why of it? I don't, not any longer. There's old stories about gods and men, past history, into myth - where the gods, they're like children, petulant, cruel. Those were the voices of the Big Empty, the past. Couldn't leave well enough alone, had to ask. Had to ask the why of it. Their answers were madness. And power, stronger than me, would take a hundred Elijahs ... someone tougher than him or I to best them in their Dome. They didn't know why they were there, what had led to that point, their names - like serpents devouring themselves, cannibalizing their own thoughts. When all seemed lost, thought it was the end - my anger gave me strength to ask them my last question. 'Who are you, that do not know your history?' and they awoke ... for a short time. The flag you wear, they said. We remember, America. It wasn't just a flag to them ... it was a place, an idea they had cared for. Once. They told me what it was like to grow in that world ... all they had done to lift it up ... protect it. They ... didn't know it was gone, that ... yet they had cared once. Before forgetting their history. As they were talking ... kept seeing the Courier's shadow behind them, giving each of their words weight. History cast aside ... a home, left behind. I listened. I asked. Was there anything left? Anything that still carries America's voice? And they told me I had already been there. I and one other, walking right out of history deeper than we knew. They told me what lies in the heart of the Divide, what can be found there. And the words to awaken it - and the one to speak them.\"<br><br><strong>Ulysses Log Y-17.21</strong><br><br><br> \"Emptiness here - like the sands of the Great Salt Lake, echoed. The beating in the Divide sky ... like storm drums of the White Legs. Ran with them on the salt beds, at Caesar's command - cut the throats of the two-headed Bear, cut all communities off. Use storm, sky. Disease, fire, starvation ... and the violence of the ignorants to ruin all who could ... might stand against him. But the White Legs ... they couldn't live on their own, like most scavengers. So gave them purpose - turned their hunger into a weapon. The wall of New Canaan... too high for Caesar. Too proud, maybe - or maybe something there from his past, that needed killing ... Memory of Graham. Helped them dig out Canaan supply caches, and other secrets the sands hid - bunkers, filled with powered weapons even the Brotherhood might desire. They called these new weapons \"storm drums\" in the firing of shells. Taught them the power in the casings ... to channel the spirits into their guns. Me ... they called me the Flag-Bearer. Glory in my hand, in my staff that still bore the weight of the Old World just as the symbol on my back did. I learned their weapons as a means of respect. And when it came their turn to pay respect to me ... history came rushing back. Can't escape what's been done. History's there ... no matter how far you walk.\"<br><br><br><strong>Ulysses Log Y-17.22</strong><br><br> \"I walked the Great Salt Lake as Caesar's eye, then his hand. Mongrels there, two-legs and four. Saw the walls of New Canaan, the scavengers circled... hadn't the strength or fire to take. Too high, too strong. White Legs, they were born for war, they run to it, hungry for battle... yet their hunger is to be a part of history, something larger. Like the Legion. As always, brought them a message - from Caesar. If New Canaan burns, Caesar might see them. 'Might.' Even the chance was a lie. To honor Caesar - destroy the history of New Canaan, and the way they carry it - in their generations and family. Caesar respects such strength, I told them. That - that was truth, even if 'strength' wasn't the word. Obediance. You must be willing to kill anyone, children, mothers, the weak, elders... If these New Canaanites value the generations, that is what you must kill. It was like Vulpes was speaking through me. Use the night silence, and fire to change their words to pleas, to screams. No need for bombs when hate will do. I... asked the White Legs to destroy a people with ancestry, going back thousands of years - another death of history, lost to time. The New Canaanites... they supplied medicine, food, traded with others. Civilization, a hand from the past, not history. But maybe a past deeper, farther than that to a place where this ... God really exists. If so, his handiwork and people belong elsewhere, not in this place. Another symbol, like Bear and Bull, with no meaning in the present.\"<br><br><strong>Ulysses Log Y-17.23</strong><br><br><br> \"The White Legs... meant to show respect, bribe me for Caesar's favor, echoing mannerisms and words ... Showed them tech caches, taught them the workings of chamber and powder, spoke of Caesar's pride in those that used such things... lies. And... and then... they tried to honor me - not the Legion. They brought me before the campfire one night, showed me how they changed themselves, how they wore their hair now. It was like my entire dead tribe in the firelight, teeth grinning red in the dark - eager corpses, blood-covered ghosts. They... had taken my braids, the way of the Twisted Hairs, as if it showed they were like me, of me... while every knot in their braids spoke of raping, violence - and ignorance of what the knots meant. They thought to show respect... defiled it. Lost myself in trying to read the braids they wove, when I remembered they had put no meaning in it. They had no history of what it meant. They didn't even know the insult in the twists, knots... and Dry Wells came rushing back, the White Legs circled like that... It was like looking at the dead of my tribe, reborn as ghosts - hateful, hungry, bowing to Caesar.

The bunker itself is located several hundred feet below the surface. Multiple layers of reinforced materials serve to prevent a breach of the inhabitable areas by anything save for a direct hit by a bunker-busting weapon utilizing a megatonnage considered outside the capability of America's closest competitors. In the event that our enemies become capable of such an attack, the bunker's DERVISH camouflage system makes targeting the site impossible for automated systems, forcing aggressors to rely on guesswork and sheer luck.<br><br><strong>Systems Overview</strong><br><br> The Hidden Valley Bunker relies on two main systems:<br><br> The CANDLE fusion power system provides power to all bunker systems. Built more for reliability and duration of service, the power output of the system has been exceeded by many current designs, but it can supply the bunker with power for an estimated 752 years.<br><br> The DERVISH camouflage system provides visual and electronic interference to prevent airborne or long-range enemy weapons from targeting the bunker. The normal soil around Hidden Valley has been supplemented with a combination of aluminum and various silicates, which are then dispersed using a widespread network of industrial fans to blanket the area in a cloud of what is essentially chaff. Combined with the electronic countermeasures of the nearby array at Black Mountain, the bunker at Hidden Valley is effectively impossible to target.<br><br><strong> Elder Dismissal Incidents</strong><br><br> &gt; Search for \"Elder+dismissal\" in topic History returned the following results.<br> &gt; Choose a result:<br><br><strong>Incident #1</strong><br><br><br> Let i be recorded that on this day, Raymond Lorn was dismissed from his post as Elder for committing the crime of murder.

Each year it is the appointed task of the ombudsman not only to officiate the election, but to chronicle it in hopes that after the last overseer has finished his term and walked to his death in the chamber beneath his office, and the vault has become still, that one day some excavator from humanity or perhaps some yet-unknown race of super beings might find our records and incorporate them into historical canon.<br><br> But lately it's occurred to me that that's not really why. I think the real reason we do it is because we want to believe that somewhere in the archives there's an answer to all of this, or perhaps there will be one when the historical records are completed and the whole story is told. We want it to make sense. To understand why the vault's mainframe will kill us if we do not offer one of our own as a yearly sacrifice. To fully comprehend why we continue to have these elections despite the unfettered corruption that has plagued it for what must be decades by now. There was a simpler time when elections meant shaking hands and kissing babies. But now with the rise of the voting blocs and this infestation of bribery, drug trafficking, smuggling, and God knows what else, we want to know why.<br><br> Well I've been through the archives, and I can tell you you won't find the answer there. You'll find an account of the first overseer, who entered the vault as the only citizen aware of the sacrifices that would have to take place. But he didn't have the answers either. If he did, surely he would've foreseen the citizens' anger when he broke the news. Surely he would've guessed that they would want to choose a sacrifice democratically, in the way that we citizens are accustomed to washing our hands of terrible deeds, and that his name would be at the top of the polls, and that the simultaneous vacancy of overseer and martyr would forever fuse the two positions here in Vault 11. But he didn't. He had the answers no more than any of us, and the records state that after the citizens discovered that the sacrificial chamber's password was his wife Betty's first name, and its door was unsealed so he could be offered as the first sacrifice, he walked down into that room crying like a child.<br><br> I can only wonder if there are no answers to be found, and we are just going along with this because we don't see another choice. Nevertheless, I still hold onto hope that we can find one. I urge you all to take the journey I took - to remember that it wasn't so long ago that we were ruled by our civility and our dignity, and that those were times when we didn't have to be quite so ashamed.

The only think that works in here is this junky old terminal.<br /><br /><b>It's a radio station!</b><br/><br/>It's amazing! This place is a radio station! If we can get it repaired, we can broadcast music across the wastes, just like Rhonda and I used to listen to. Ah Rhonda, how I wish you hadn't gone away. I asked all of the mutants here to help, but none of them could do anything for you. Which makes me doubt they can fix this place...<br /><br /><b>On the air!</b><br/><br/>The radio station is fixed, and we've begun sending our message out into the desert. Marcus thinks I spend too much time in here, but what does a first gen know? Rhonda says they're just one step from dumb dumbs, and I agree.<br /><br /><b>The elite!</b><br/><br/>There was a fight in the yard between some of us and the first gens. Marcus made a speech about how we need to work together, but why should we? We were the master's favorites! We don't need their help. Rhonda says we'd be better off without them.<br /><br /><b>Alone at last!</b><br/><br/>Marcus and the others left today. Finally, we have the whole place to ourselves! No more listening to lectures about what we can and can't say on the air. The airwaves will be free!<br /><br />Now Rhonda and I can host our own radio show like we've been planning. I don't know why Marcus always refused to let us do it before. He always started getting real nervous when I him what Rhonda thought about things. Rhonda says he was afraid she was too smart to control.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the start of a new era! the only downside is most of the dumb dumbs chose to stay.<br /><br /><b>Safe!</b><br/><br/>I finally got Raul to finish installing the security measures on my door. Now I can have all the privacy I want.<br /><br />Just in case I have a dumb dumb moment, I've placed the spare key under the stairs behind my building. No one ever goes back there, so it should be safe from discovery.<br /><br /><b>Lucky</b><br/><br/>Great news! A ghoul entered our camp today who has experience fixing machines!

I miss you so much, Sarah! This place makes me want to run back to our home, every single day. I just had to write you so that I could feel a bit warmer. The warehouse's cold air weighs on me as heavily as the concrete that Mr. House dumped in our vault. Damned be his soul!<br><br> Yeah, I imagine that you did not expect that outburst from your \"cool bro\" but I am reaching the end of the corridor, here. Emptiness is my muse - doubt is my only mistress. Everything that once inspired my art slowly drifts back into nothingness, into an unfathomable void where neither I find light nor its radiance searches for the spring of my soul.<br><br> Bah, don't I sound pathetic? I do not wish to worry you, lil sis. I just wish that I could be there with you, right now. Perhaps once I find my strength again, once I finish the latest \"suggestion\" for Mr. House, I'll venture into the Strip and visit you.<br><br> My thoughts are with you, hot-headed roadster!<br><br><strong>Our Influential Friends</strong><br><br> Dear Miss Weintraub,<br><br> This is Charlene Tann writing to say thank you for the great experience we had at your hotel! I can't wait to tell to my inner circle. As you recall, my husband Biff is a very respected and influential man in our wealthy community.<br><br> Ms. Shot, Ingrid Denger and lady Booften will soon come for tea to our estate and I will direct them your way. They will love the quaint and rustic feel of your cramped underground hole - tres chic!<br><br> Even Biff still talks about his new favorite ranging garb, \"the leather from my Vault 21 suit contains the scent of unwashed ages\" he says to all our visitors!

Even with those legionnaires bad news we still get plenty of NCR squares down here. They are all chirpy and don't appear to mind that Cesar is crusin' for a bruisin' all over the place. Maybe the NCR is stronger than we thought, uh? Don't know... you think we can trust them over Mr. House?<br><br> I still feel all clutched over what he did to our home! I mean, yeah it is good that we got to keep part of our vault but I can't shake the thought that one of these days he'll just push me out into the open - once he does not need us any more. I tell you, we should have never accepted his challenge. That shuckster cheated us, I am sure!<br><br> Anyway, you've heard all of that before and I just wanted to bring you a smile!

In the spirit of Las Vegas, our vault was built and organized around gambling!<br><br> Everything you will see here follows the idea that humans can coexist and organize their lives based on the principle that skill is the only factor that should tip the blind balance held by Lady Luck.<br><br> We embodied the perfect equilibrium between self-reliance and social equality.<br><br> Each level of Vault 21 was symmetrical and transparent. Each room looked exactly like the next, and every gambling place was built in plain sight, so that no person would have advantage over another.<br><br> Thanks to this, quarrels in our society were solved from an equal starting ground - the best won, just like our American Dream promised so long ago!<br><br> After two-hundred years of living in harmony, we finally awoke to the nature of the outside world when Mr. House, in his able wisdom, resurrected our lost city as New Vegas!<br><br><strong>Opening to a New World</strong><br><br> Seven years ago, Mr. House rebuilt and organized the great city of New Vegas. Vault 21 rests in the middle of The Strip, and it was inevitable that it would become part of the city's bright future. Mr. House contacted our community and offered us to participate in the resurgence of New Vegas.<br><br> Most Vault 21 dwellers refused the offer - life was comfortable, safe and fruitful. We had grown so accustomed to the benefits of our isolated society that we could not conceive leaving it behind for an unknown future teetering on a precarious balance. Still, there were some among us who disagreed with the prevailing wisdom.<br><br> They challenged, on Mr. House's behalf, each of the vault-levels' representatives that supported continuing our isolation. According to the custom, a game would be set up where the winner would decide the course of the community's future.<br><br> A game of blackjack was scheduled and held in this very level of Vault 21. After many hours of grueling struggle, Mr. House's supporters won in an extremely risky, and fateful, gambit. They decided to open up the doors to the outside world.<br><br> The rest upheld our system and remained true to their promise to abide by the victor's decision.<br><br> After almost two hundred years within Vault 21's halls, we released the seals of the ancient doors. We opened to a new world.<br><br><strong>A Tribute to Mr. House</strong><br><br> Mr. House, with the help of The Families, had transformed the mostly unharmed ruins of Las Vegas into a paradise. It resembled the city that we remembered thanks to the stories and items that our forefathers told and secured in Vault 21 after The Cataclysm.<br><br> We were awe-struck and cautious, at once. Slowly, we left the confines of the vault and settled within New Vegas, aiding in its reconstruction.<br><br> Vault 21, a giant complex of functioning machinery, became a great source of materials with which to rebuild New Vegas.<br><br> Mr. House stripped the vault and filled its empty husk with concrete - only leaving behind part of the vault's top level. This section is where you now find hospice and where the warmth of our ancient home remains alive for all to enjoy!<br><br> We have come to recognize the wisdom of Mr. House in forging a new and brighter future for all generations of New Vegas' inhabitants. Without his leadership, the barren wasteland would have remained uncivilized, savage and brutal for all time.<br><br> We sincerely hope that you join us in celebrating the glory of New Vegas and the memory of Vault 21's legacy!", "authors": ["Charlene Tann", "Sarah", "Sheldon Weintraub", "Unknown[Fallout]"]}]}
