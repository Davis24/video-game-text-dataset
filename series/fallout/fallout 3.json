Have you heard about the synthetic men they make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, the rumors are true. They're called androids. They're men like us, just made out of different parts. I know one of these androids. He's looking for a trustworthy doctor to perform some facial surgery. Can you do it? Do you know someone who can? Also, do you know anyone who's really a wiz with computers?<br /><br /><b>Assignment from the Commonwealth</b><br/><br/>We've a little assignment from the Commonwealth. A very important slave escaped into the Wasteland. Well, it's not exactly a slave. It's what they call an android. A kind of synthetic man. The important thing isn't what this guy is. The important thing is the job pays more than you can imagine. He thinks the synthman might be looking to get in touch with a doctor and/or tech-head. If you want a cut, then get a move on.<br /><br /><b>Rogue Android</b><br/><br/>You'll never guess who just showed up at my place! That android catcher from the Commonwealth! At first I thought he was going to kill me. But it turns out he's an android himself! And he's gone rogue! I didn't believe him at first, but I'm convinced he's telling the truth. We need to find him a place to hide along the Railroad. He also insists that we help him locate a trusted doctor and techie.<br /><br /><b>Androids are real. No really!</b><br/><br/>You've heard those rumors about androids? You know, those synthetic men they supposedly make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, a friend of a friend knows a guy that met one! No really, it's true! He's running away from his masters. Word is he's looking for a doctor to do some kind of surgery, and a computer programmer of some kind. Can you believe that? Let me know if you hear something.<br /><hr/><br /><b>A request for help</b><br/><br/>If you're listening to this recording, it is because you're believed to be trustworthy. I hope that is the case, because this recording puts us both in danger. I'm escaping from the Commonwealth. I'm an android, a synthetic man... a slave. The men hunting me are ruthless and will stop at nothing to retrieve their property. I need to find a doctor in the Wasteland to perform facial reconstruction. I also need someone who knows a great deal about computers. I need... I need to have my memories erased and my face altered to look like someone else.<br /><hr/><br /><b>We got the tech, now we need the doc.</b><br/><br/>We now have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. We just need to find someone with the skills and willingness to perform the surgery. If anyone knows of a discreet and trustworthy surgeon who knows how to keep his mouth shut, send him our way. Also, we need to find a Circuit Neuralizer to reroute the signals in the android's memory. Do you know any trustworthy techies?<br /><br /><b>Get it done!</b><br/><br/>Time's running out on finding that android. We don't get him soon, someone else will. Zimmer doesn't seem to understand we're the best at this sort of thing. I'm sure he's hired others, too. He won't shut up about the thing. He was babbling about a \"Lipoplasticator\" and \"Micro Dermal Graftilizer.\" What are those, you ask? Apparently something doctors use to mess up someone's face beyond recognition. So we don't even have a description to work off of. To make matters worse, he now thinks the android got his memories wiped or something. Find some tech-junkies, knock on some doors, and try to find something called a \"Circuit Neuralizer.\" Knock on some heads, too, if you have to. Get it done!<br /><br /><b>Extreme measures</b><br/><br/>The android's decided on extreme measures. He knows all the techniques of the retrieval trade, and is afraid facial reconstruction isn't enough. He wants his memories erased and replaced with new ones. I don't know how that's going to work. Start asking around for trustworthy tech-heads. We need to find something called a Circuit Neuralizer and a person who knows how to use one. Also, we have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer, now we need to find a doctor able and willing to perform the facial reconstruction. We need to hurry. They've come very close to discovering the Railroad!<br /><br /><b>Oh man! A Circuit Neuralizer!</b><br/><br/>Remember that secret android project I told you about? Well, they got some serious prewar tech on their hands. They nabbed a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer for the facial reconstruction. Not sure where they'll find a chopper with enough skills to use it without making him look like a freaking ghoul. Oh, and get this. Can you believe they found a Circuit Neuralizer? That or someone built one! Word is that they're going to completely rewire the brain of one of those things. If you know who they got working on this, let me know. I want to meet the guy.<br /><br /><hr/><b>A free man... a new man...</b><br/><br/>Despite the harshness of the Wasteland, I've discovered in more than a few here, a compassion that is unheard of in the Commonwealth. Perhaps it's the daily struggle for life here which gives appreciation for life in general, whether human, or android. In a few days I'll be a free man... a new man.

Simply point, shoot, and subdue!\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nSimply stated, the Mesmetron sends out a series of waves that short circuit key areas of the target&#39;s brain. Much like a radio signal, only instead of a radio picking up pleasant music, the target&#39;s brain picks up a series of complex and confusing signals that overwhelm the synaptic pathways with erroneous data, turning off important high-level thought centers and voluntary motor control.\n\nCLASS B &quot;Experimentally Efficient&quot; CLASSIFICATION:\n\nWarning! The Mesmetron is still designated as a Class B &quot;experimentally efficient&quot; weapon.\n\nThis means, that from time to time, unexpected, and potentially embarrassing side effect may be experienced (see your supervisor or commanding officer before using on civilians).\n\nOccasional anomalous effects that have been recorded by field tests against certain targets include:\n\n1.) Increased aggression\n\n2.)

Soon after we arrived, my nightly routine included sneaking into the restricted areas. Searching for, I don't know, whatever I could find. It was a Vault-Tec facility after all. The place was built with some of the most advanced technology this country had ever developed. Those excursions never turned up anything particularly useful. So one night, after half a bottle of scotch, I broke into the Overseer's office. It was easy enough to hack his console, gain access to the restricted files. Most of it was garbage: propaganda, spy reports, just plain rambling bullshit, really. But there was one thing, one name that stood out amongst all the others... Dr. Stanislaus Braun. I knew of Braun's work, of course. He was a celebrity in his day. Vault-Tec's sorcerer-scientist, leaving his peers in awe of his technological wizardry. But it was in Vault 101 that night in the Overseer's office, that I first learned of Braun's involvement in Vault-Tec's social preservation program, and his work on something called GECK, the Garden of Eden Creation Kit.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Personal Journals #8</b><br><br><br>To be honest, the GECK sounded like pure fantasy, even for someone of Braun's capabilities. It was nothing short of a miracle. A terra-forming module, capable of producing life from complete lifelessness. But not only was this thing a reality, it was actually distributed to several vaults to be used after an atomic war. Vault 101 was, sadly, not on that list. I did some digging and discovered Braun's name on the reservation list for a Vault 112. I'm no slouch, but this man, he could have easily succeeded where I failed. Does his collected knowledge remain within the halls of Vault 112? Journals, holotapes, computer records, maybe even experiments? If I could gain access to just a fraction of Braun's genius, Project Purity would become a reality.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Personal Journals #10</b><br><br><br>I'm off to Vault 112 to search for anything of Braun's that might help me get this purifier up and running.

This can be counteracted by submerging the barrel of the weapon in water, which helps cool heat sinks located beneath the chassis shell in that area.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Research Note - Plasma Rifle</b><br/><br/><br>===Weapons Research===<br /><br><br /><br>Subject -> Plasma Rifle<br /><br><br /><br>Researcher -> R. R. Rasting<br /><br><br /><br>Analysis -> The Plasma Rifle, like the Laser Rifle, uses a micro fusion cell as its power supply. It taps into the cell, essentially a small fusion reactor, to produce a toroid of plasma that is ejected down a superconductor barrel. A typical micro fusion cell can supply the rifle with around eight shots. Further research needs to be done to determine exactly how the plasma retains its density while traveling through the air toward its target.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Research Note - Minigun</b><br/><br/><br>===Weapons Research===<br /><br><br /><br>Subject -> Minigun<br /><br><br /><br>Researcher -> H. P. Smith<br /><br><br /><br>Analysis -> Why am I researching such old technology? Practice, practice, practice, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, the Minigun uses a much smaller round than most of the rifles found throughout the Wastes. However, the rate of fire of the Minigun makes up for the small, 5mm round, sending a hail of bullets toward its target. Its shear size, coupled with its trademark sound, is enough to send anyone in its path running for cover. It's a great weapon for suppressing fire, letting others flank the unsuspecting enemy. A typical cartridge holds around 100 rounds.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Research Note - Pulse Grenade</b><br/><br/><br>===Weapons Research===<br /><br><br /><br>Subject -> Pulse Grenade<br /><br><br /><br>Researcher -> L. J. Rogers<br /><br><br /><br>Analysis -> The Pulse Grenade is the most effective weapon against robotics. Upon detonation, an intense electromagnetic pulse is emitted, severely crippling any robotics within the explosion radius. They are extremely handy against the many robots and turrets found throughout the Capital Wasteland.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Research Note - Enclave Armor</b><br/><br/><br>===Armor Research===<br /><br><br /><br>Subject -> Enclave Armor<br /><br><br /><br>Researcher ->T. T. Bowser<br /><br><br /><br>Analysis -> After several radiation experiments, I can safely conclude that the Enclave Armor is more radiation resistant than Power Armor, although not by much. Regardless, more research and tests are needed to determine exactly what makes it more resistant.<br /><br><br /><br><b>Research Note - Missle Launcher</b><br/><br/><br>===Weapons Research===<br /><br><br /><br>Subject -> Missile Launcher<br /><br><br /><br>Researcher ->J. J. Browne<br /><br><br /><br>Analysis -> After several attempts to modify the Missile Launcher to increase its accuracy, I conclude that it cannot be done. In fact, this is third one I've \"broken\" in the past month. I will pass the task on to L. J. Rogers, who seems confident enough that it can be modified and that I merely overlooked obvious miscalculations. Technically, the Missile Launcher I've recently worked on is not broken.

The new Protectrons are here only to protect you, the workers. Also, please remember to carry your ID with you at all times. The Protectrons are programmed to make sure those present in the plant are valid employees.<br><br> - Management<br><br><strong> Regarding recent incident</strong><br><br> Those employees who recently took it upon themselves to incapacitate a Protectron with a bucket of water and sledgehammer have been dealt with and no longer work at the plant. Let this be a reminder to all employees. Those caught harassing and/or damaging the Factory Protectrons will be dealt with swiftly and severely.<br><br> - Management<br><br> <strong>Regarding new shipment</strong><br><br> We've ordered three new Protectrons to be installed immediately in the plant.

The other two will take their positions working on the assembly line.<br><br> - Management<br><br> <strong>Private entry 1</strong><br><br> I brought it up with Management today that the men down at the plant aren't taking the new shipment of robots lightly. They fear losing their jobs and I don't blame them. It's my job to make sure morale stays high no matter what happens. It's hard to look each man in the eye and tell him that he has nothing to worry about even though I very well know he'll be unemployed in less than a month. I don't know how long I can continue to lie to these men.<br><br> Tom McMullin<br>  Supply Plant Supervisor<br><br><strong> Private entry 2</strong><br><br> I've managed to delay a rather large shipment of Protectrons today. I told management that we've been having problems with the previous batch of robots and are not prepared for another batch anytime soon. This is complete bullshit of course, the robots work perfectly. They outperform our best worker by a factor of five. The men continue to lose morale day after day. Some blame me, but they don't understand that this is completely out of my hands. I am doing everything I can to help these men keep their jobs.<br><br> Tom McMullin<br>  Supply Plant Supervisor<br><br><strong> Private entry 3</strong><br><br> Management made a surprise visit to the plant today. I guess they stopped believing what I've been telling them about the robots not performing to standards. They saw first hand the speed and efficiency of the robots. Unfortunately, they also caught two employees in the act of tearing apart a Protectron and smashing it with a sledgehammer. I was to blame of course. The men are starting to believe I'm working closely with the managers and helping them in every way possible to save my own skin.<br><br> Tom McMullin<br>  Supply Plant Supervisor<br><br><strong> Private entry 4</strong><br><br> News broke out today over the loud speakers that everyone needs to vacate the plant by 1 PM. \"Due to budget cuts, this plant is shutting down.\" The men knew at once there was no budget cut. They ultimately decided I was to blame, having seniority in this section of the plant. As soon as I heard the news, I grabbed my pistol and made for the exit. It was quickly barricaded. I turned around and ran into this utility closet and locked the door behind me. I'll stay in here until the men go home.<br><br> Tom McMullin<br>  Supply Plant Supervisor<br><br> <strong>Private entry 5</strong><br><br> The men won't leave. They're determined to wait until I come out. Probably going to give me one hell of a beating, that I'm sure of. I wish they understood how hard I worked for them, how I used every opportunity to delay the inevitable. They better get going though, it's almost 1 PM. The robots will be here in a half hour, sooner if management hears of what's happening.<br><br> Tom McMullin<br>  Supply Plant Supervisor<br><br><strong> Private entry 6</strong><br><br> I begged them to leave before the robots got here. They laughed and said they'd take care of the robots, it's me they wanted. Then came the familiar rattle of a Protectron. That got their attention. I soon heard laughter, cursing, and screaming down the hall. I opened the door and stepped outside. A couple of the workers burst around the corner screaming for help. A red laser lashed out from down the hall and severed Tim's right arm in two. I panicked and ran back into the closet and shut the door. The men slammed into the door and begged me to open it. I didn't say a word, just sat stunned, listening to their screams of agony as the robot finished them off one by one. Then silence. I put my ear to the door and listened. I heard the clanking of Protectron feet down the hall. I grabbed my pistol and backed away from the door. No way am I opening this door for anyone or anything!

I guess the registry program came and went here at some point. There's some leftover equipment from them I've been authorized to remove from storage and use. We've got some basic antibiotics and hygiene supplies, and a couple boxes of New Plague awareness pamphlets. Not much to work with yet, but we were at least able to get settled into the motel. For now I'll focus on setting up our outreach center with Victoria while the rest of our volunteers get out into the community and get a feel for their situation here.<br><br><strong> Log Entry 002</strong><br><br> The location we were given as our outreach center was a joke. The place is half-built and what's been put together so far looks like it's going to fall in on itself anytime. The real estate company wasn't much help. I sent a request for some field supplies so we can set up an outdoor center until this situation can be improved upon. My volunteers are telling me that a lot of the area lacks basic infrastructure, so we'll probably want to get started with some basic vaccines and sanitation supplies. I included some of this on today's purchase request, but I don't feel like we've got enough of a grasp on the local situation to request much more than that just yet.<br><br><strong> Log Entry 003</strong><br><br> We staged our first outreach event today, which didn't go well. The majority of the population in the central area of Point Lookout are transplants from nearby urban centers - lots of contracted construction workers, support staff for local businesses, a handful of business people involved in the construction projects. We're here to help the rural population who don't have a pot to piss in, but those people don't seem to come into town. We need to re-evaluate our efforts. The local populace seems recluse. We'll have to get creative with our outreach.<br><br> <strong>Log Entry 004</strong><br><br> Victoria was badly wounded today. She took a truck of supplies out to the Ark &amp; Dove Cathedral beyond the river. Most of the locals we want to help are living in primitive dwellings in the wetlands. The Cathedral offered the closest public building to that area. She wasn't in much state to give details, but it sounds like nobody was around when she arrived. She ventured into the swamps to try and make contact with locals at one of the shacks out there. The paramedics are treating a wound on the back of her head. She'll be okay, but it sounds like her skull was fractured. Victoria doesn't remember anything beyond blacking out. There was nothing stolen from her person or the medical supplies, but I'm still going to err on the side of caution and forbid volunteers from wandering out there alone.

A child, to be precise.\"<br><br><br>Add to the sinister forensic findings this statement from Christopher Atkinson, the one surviving victim of the adolescent assassin, and it becomes clear that the Pint-Sized Slasher does indeed walk among us: \"The clown!

The AEP7 features a new design in the photonic focusing chamber as well as an entirely redesigned focusing crystal pattern. The bulk and weight have both been reduced over previous models and it was likely that within the new few development cycles, the successor to the AEP7 would replace the N99 10mm as the standard issue sidearm for all forces.<br><br><br>The AEP7 took advantage of new manufacturing techniques developed shortly before the Great War. Although many were produced, most did not make it into field service because of logistics problems concerning their deployment during active wartime.<br><br><br>The AEP7 can be a rare find in the Capital Wasteland, and any models that are produced should be returned to the Citadel for repair and recalibrating before field deployment.<br><br><br><strong>AER9 laser rifle</strong><br><br><br>Unlike many of the weapons in use today, the AER9 is actually not the top laser rifle that was in service at the time of the Great War. The model line went up to the state-of-the-art AER12, which saw service in a handful of specialty units. The reason that the AER9 is much more commonly found is that it was much sturdier and more reliable than the models that followed.<br><br><br>The AER9 features a titanium housed crystal array which proved to withstand long years of exposure to the elements much better than the gold alloy housing of the later models. As a result, the crystal arrays stayed focused within operating parameters, rather than falling completely out of focus like the newer models.<br><br><br>As with all energy weapons, the AER9 can suffer from poor performance if not properly maintained. The crystal arrays and non-mechanical components are delicate and if not properly serviced can lead to a loss of beam intensity, overheating, and energy regulation failure.<br><br><br><strong>N99 10mm pistol</strong><br><br><br>The 10mm N99 sidearm was standard issue military gear following the phase out of the N80 in 2051. The N99 was known for its ability to survive in the harshest of conditions and in many tests, the weapon was able to reliably be restored to working condition after an extended period of time exposed to hard elements and without maintenance.<br><br><br>The N99 proved to stand up to its claims and as a result, is one of the most common weapons found in use in the Wasteland. While many civilian weapons were ruined beyond use in the exterior conditions following the war, the N99 is commonly able to be easily restored to working order by anyone with the most basic knowledge of firearm mechanics.<br><br><br>However, an N99 in poor condition can often deliver low target and armor penetration, frequent jamming, and greatly reduced accuracy. Fortunately, the weapon was produced in great numbers and units are available for replacement parts.<br><br><br><strong>R91 5.56mm assault rifle</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The R Series of combat assault rifles was used reliably following the discontinuation of the M series in the early 21st century. The R series, produced by civilian manufacturer Stent Security Solutions, was made in many models and variations. The variation most common to the DC Wasteland is the R91 full-auto urban assault rifle.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This rifle was standard issue for the National Guard during urban pacification operations. Fortunately for our purposes, the Nation Guard had been fully deployed around the DC area during the time of the war. As a result, the R91 is readily available for those willing to search. Although nearly two centuries of scavenging has reduced the numbers of working units, the R91 remains a favorite of Slavers and raiders. This rifle can also often be obtained from legitimate traders and arms dealers.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Like any firearm, the R91's effectiveness and accuracy can suffer without regular maintenance.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h1>Maxson Archive terminal</h1><br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Maxson Family Dossiers</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Roger Maxson<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Born -- NA<br><br><br>Died -- 2135<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Second in command of the security team stationed at the West Tek research facility; later relocated to the Mariposa Military Base.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Assumed command after nervous breakdown of security team leader Colonel Robert Spindel.

The Delta IX was in use for almost 15 years before being converted for military use and having the crew and instruments sections replaced with a nuclear warhead. The Delta IX recorded over 77 successful launches, making it one of the most successful rockets in U.S. History.<br><br><br> The rocket, developed entirely by USSA scientists, was a single-stage vehicle with an ejectable crew section or satellite storage bay. The propulsion system was a nuclear-electric derivative drive, using a massive electrical jolt to start the nuclear reaction on launch. The crew section was protected from the radioactive chambers by way of a massive titanium-vanadium disc. The spacecraft had the capability to sustain 2 astronauts for up to 24 days maximum. The longest recorded spaceflight in a Delta IX rocket was the 17-day Zeus 12 Mission to the moon.<br><br>", "authors": "B.

My security clearance isn't high enough to know this on an official level, but I have it on good authority that we're under threat of a Chinese attack. I don't dare share this with the girls; most of them are a solid sort, but I can't trust that some won't desert to try and protect themselves or their families, and wind up spreading panic, especially on flimsy rumors based on flimsier intelligence from DoD.<br><br> We haven't been debriefed yet, but it's probably safe to assume we'll be on an evacuation detail in the rural areas. Our unit scored somewhat poorly in the last round of drills, and the high-flyers always get the urban details; we'll be stuck herding farmers and hermits in the hills.<br><br><strong> Log 2</strong><br><br> This can't have happened. We don't even know if it was the Chinese, but DC was hit. My God. Andrea's unit was on evac detail right on the Belt Loop.<br><br> Dear God. More bombs. What's happening?<br><br><strong> Log 3</strong><br><br> Our unit has been assigned to a National Guard detachment. They drove all night from Pennsylvania. We're doing our best to keep the survivors placated while these boys get their strength up. The looting gets worse every day, and it's a small town. There can't be much left, and there's already been one scuffle at the canteen. These Guardsmen arrived just in time, I fear.<br><br><strong> Log 4</strong><br><br> Dolores and Rebecca deserted in the night. They had the goodness not to rob us blind on their way out: I had trusted Becky with the keys to the canteen, and the artesian well we locked up on Day One. Several of our survivors were talking rubbish about seeking refuge in a nearby Vault, the girls must have decided to go with them. Damned fools; if anybody made it into those things in time, they bloody well aren't letting any of us in now. I suppose I should just be glad that we have a few less mouths to feed.<br><br><strong> Log 5</strong><br><br> I took the NCO's advice and set up a quarantine for the worst of the radiation victims. We know better than to think they're contagious, but most of our survivors don't, and it helps keep them calm. We also have an easier time smuggling the bodies out at night. It's not so much that people die; it's how they look when they go. They all think they'll just lose a bit of hair, maybe get a rash. It gets so much worse than that.<br><br><strong> Log 6</strong><br><br> We're low on Prussian Blue. Most of them don't know what that really means, for which I'm thankful. One of the local doctors in our camp knows about a cancer treatment facility not too far from here. We're sending some of the guardsmen out to investigate. If they can recover any filgrastim, we might be able to stave off widespread radiation sickness a little longer.<br><br> <strong>Log 7</strong><br><br> These days I feel like more of a preacher than a nurse. We've lost hope that the reservists will be back. I can only hope they died with some scrap of honor and didn't abandon us. Without medication, people are succumbing to radiation sickness, for which there is no hope of treatment. We can do nothing more than make our patients comfortable as we await the end. When the painkillers and whiskey run out, prayer is all that we can offer them. I've taken to wearing a headwrap; I don't want them to see how much of my own hair has fallen out.<br><br><strong> Log 8</strong><br><br> I suppose it seems only right to say goodbye. I ought to know it's hopeless, but maybe one of my sisters is still out there, and I couldn't go without leaving some kind of farewell. Just know that I did everything I could.

I have three of Professor Malleus's team doing what I need to get done and hope to show some concrete results soon.

I was able to record an entire symphony... Haydn's Symphony No. 3 in d minor. It was so beautiful! I could barely keep up with everyone else in the string section, but they were so nice.

We will emphasize the drink's new energy content and flavor.<br><br> The tag line will be \"Take the leap... enjoy a Quantum!\"<br><br><strong> Stage Three</strong><br><br> Stage Three of the Nuka-Cola Quantum marketing will include: 4 (four) 30 (thirty)-second television commercials, 4 (four) 15 (fifteen)-second radio commercials and a highway billboard campaign.<br><br> In this final stage we will aggressively compare the drink to other competitors and show their inferiority using hired actors at \"taste tests\". The actors will read pre-written scripts approved by our department. The text should give an authentic \"on the spot\" impression but still clearly point out Quantum's strengths.<br><br> The tag line will remain: \"Take the leap... enjoy a Quantum!\"", "authors": "Unknown[Fallout]"}, "22600": {"title": "Tenpenny Tower terminal entries", "text": "<h1>Lounge Computer (Federalist Lounge)</h1><br> RobCo Service Terminal<br>  V 6.0.3.2.1.a<br>  ------------------------------------<br>  For More Top Of The Line<br>  RobCo Products See<br>  Your Local Showroom.<br><br><h1> Exploration Database</h1><br> Hello, Daring! May the twilight of your life be filled with the same wonder and adventure as your youth.<br><br><strong> People</strong><br><br><strong> King Crag</strong><br><br> Good Ole' Craggy, King of Rockopolis.<br><br> He offered Argyle and me shelter back in the summer of '48. Unfortunately, there was a little incident with his daughter, and we were exiled.<br><br> We sought shelter again a couple years later, but Craggy didn't take to kindly to us luring the Slavers into his hidden underground city.<br><br> That was the last time I ever saw Argyle -- right after he saved my hide for the hundredth time.<br><br><strong> Miss Penelope Chase</strong><br><br> Miss Penelope Chase -- Two-timing bitch. She got what she deserved.<br><br><strong> Destiny Chao</strong><br><br> My dearest Destiny.<br><br> Harlot par excellence and the proprietor of the Blue Destiny Brothel. One of the loveliest women I've ever had the pleasure to pleasure.<br><br> Sadly, she died from cholera in the summer of '49 (an event that closed down the brothel forever).<br><br><strong> Argyle</strong><br><br> The best manservant a guy could ask for.<br><br> Tough, loyal, and a hell of a good friend (even if he did smell like a bag of rotten meat, but what's a Ghoul gonna do?).<br><br> The last time I saw Argyle was in Rockopolis, decades ago. I know he's still out there... somewhere.<br><br><strong> Harmon Jurley</strong><br><br> Slaver leader and psychotic cannibal, circa 2250. See entry on Paradise Falls.<br><br><strong> Places</strong><br><br><strong> Paradise Falls</strong><br><br> The most dangerous dump in the Capital Wasteland.<br><br> The Slavers there would have bought and sold anything with a pulse. They still will, from what I hear.<br><br> Back in my day, they were more disorganized, though. Their leader was a guy named Harmon Jurley, a psychotic son of a bitch who was rumored to eat the slaves he couldn't sell.<br><br><strong> Rockopolis</strong><br><br> An underground city.<br><br> Not a bad a accomplishment, all things considered, but their leader, King Crag, became too isolationist for his own good.<br><br> Okay, so I accidentally led the Slavers there and those bastards cleaned the place out. It was an honest mistake.<br><br><strong> Blue Destiny Brothel</strong><br><br> The best damn whorehouse in the Capital Wasteland. Strong booze and soft women. It shut down in the summer of '49 when most of the ladies died from a cholera outbreak.<br><br> <strong>Underworld</strong><br><br> A city of the dead. Or undead, as some would believe.<br><br> Underworld was, and is, a settlement of Ghouls, established in an old art exhibit in the Museum of American History.<br><br> Argyle and I used to go there quite a bit. I was even voted \"Honorary Ghoul\" back in '51. I really should go back and visit sometime.<br><br><strong> Megaton</strong><br><br> A town built around an undetonated atomic bomb. My kind of place!<br><br> Megaton is pretty well fortified now, but back in my day it was even more ramshackle. Great place to grab a drink or a broad.<br><br> I hear Moriarty even has his own place now. Guess that shouldn't surprise me. That guy had been playing the angles since the day he ended up in this country, as a kid.<br><br> <strong>Pests</strong><br><br> <strong>Mirelurks</strong><br><br> Goddamn walking crabs.<br><br> Tough to kill, but pretty delicious afterwards. The outer carapace is hell to penetrate, though. Good thing their face isn't armored (and Argyle had such a good right jab).<br><br><strong> Feral Ghouls</strong><br><br> Ghouls gone bad. Their brains had rotted through so much, they lost the ability to think straight.<br><br> Argyle and I fought these hapless zombie bastards more times than I can count.<br><br> I think he actually liked killing them -- saw it as some sort of revenge against God for his own situation, or something.<br><br> <strong>Radscorpions</strong><br><br> I've been a lot of places in my day, and everywhere you'd find those damned Radscorpions.<br><br> Rumor was they'd descended from Emperor Scorpions, which you could find in pretty much any pet store in the country when bombs fell. I guess that explains their population.<br><br><strong> Yao Guai</strong><br><br> Bears, or the Capital Wasteland's equivalent, anyway.<br><br> You're not going to find one of these babies balancing on a big rubber ball, though, I can tell you that much. They're are vicious as they come -- razor sharp claws, razor sharp teeth. Nasty, nasty temperament.<br><br> <strong>Robobrains</strong><br><br> I have to admit, I've always been fascinated by these things.<br><br> Such an ingenious creation -- a robot powered by a brain, and a sexy dame's voice. Of course, I always had to wonder. Were they human brains? Were they actually the brains of sexy dames?? Or is it all monkey brains and recordings?<br><br> Anyway, I got hit by one of their mind blasts once.

I must return to my original formulas and begin the process all over again. Perhaps the pressure of working in these conditions without proper laboratory equipment is to blame, perhaps I simply didn't splice the correct genetic instructions or perhaps I am fatigued. Whatever the case may be, A27 is proving to be a disaster. I must introduce a new formula soon or I may not be alive to see my hypothesis come to fruition.<br><br><strong> Sample location discovered!</strong><br><br> I've found the perfect specimen for my experiments inside Marigold station! I've set up shop underground for now while I prepare the experiment. All I need is a bit of last-minute programming on my robot and it will be ready to perform the delicate injections.

I'll be damned if I'm going to die here.<br><br> Now that we're cut off from Lesko and Wilks, I think we're on our own. The damn ants keep trying to find a way to get inside the house. Even as I'm typing this, I can hear them scraping the walls looking for a way through. I don't know how much longer we can last.<br><br><strong> 4-02-2277</strong><br><br> I'm going to have to find a better way to protect Sheila and Will from those ants. Ever since Lesko came to town, I'm certain they're getting more and more aggressive. Wasteland ants are bad enough, but at least you could run away from them. These would seem to pursue you to the ends of the earth if they could. Call me crazy, but I swear I saw one start a fire the other day. I don't know how this could be happening.<br><br> I've decided to dig up my old sidearm and keep it hidden on me at all times. If those things get too close, I'll blast the antennae right off their ugly heads.<br><br><strong> 2-24-2277</strong><br><br> These ants are becoming a real pain in the ass. So much so that I had to take a trip to Megaton and buy a better gun to protect my family. It cost me a small fortune...I had to trade every bit of ant meat I had collected, but it was worth it. I'm teaching Frank and Sheila to use it just in case something happens to me. If one of you are reading this, and I'm gone, I keep the gun in the kitchen behind the old fridge.<br><br><strong> 11-15-2276</strong><br><br> Some scientist named Lesko moved in with the Wilks family across the street.

I dunno who he's working for, but I don't think they're still looking for me.<br><br> Our supplies are running low, and I need to begin foraging for food and some better drinking water. I'd have an easier time if it wasn't for the damn ants. I swear they have a nest around here somewhere.<br><br><strong> 10-30-2276</strong><br><br> I was scavenging some of the near buildings for junk to sell and came across a working radio. No sooner did I turn it on than I heard the familiar patriotic anthems they used to play whenever Richardson would give a speech. But this was different. Who the hell is President Eden? When did that happen? Are they on this coast too? Most importantly, will they come looking for me?<br><br> I hope this journey wasn't a huge mistake.<br><br><strong> 10-02-2276</strong><br><br> I've finally found a quiet place for my family. We've been running from one settlement to the next, just trying to keep out of sight. Now that I'm on the other coast, I feel mush safer.<br><br> The family across the way from us seems pretty decent. Their kid, Bryan, likes to play with my son, which is great. It's hard for Will to make friends because we haven't stayed in one place long enough.

Small production run of prototype weapons developed by US Military.<br><br> Critical Components<br><br> Power drawn from Micro fusion Cell is processed through a Wave/Particle Diverter (manuf:Gen Atomics Intnl). Diverters are protected by carbon-fiber housing, preventing frequent malfunction, but when a diverter fails the weapon becomes unusable, and this part is extremely difficult to replace or repair.<br><br> Precision-cut lenses focus optic energy. Lenses are prone to damage and can grossly affect precision of the firing weapon's firing mechanism. Lenses are easily replaced with any clear glass, but require a great deal of skill to fabricate.<br><br> Field Operation<br><br> A fully charged cell will discharge 20 bolts from a pistol, and 12 shots from the rifle model. Recoil is negligible compared to ballistic weapons, so long range combat requires less marksmanship ability of the soldier.<br><br> Maintenance<br><br> The chassis are easily opened, allowing the weapon to be serviced in the field. Purified water and a clean cloth can be used to wash mirrored and glass components, slowing wear on the weapon. The weapon can also overheat after a period of intense use. This can be counteracted by submerging the barrel of the weapon in water, which helps cool heat sinks located beneath the chassis shell in that area.<br><br> <strong>Research Note - Enclave Armor</strong><br><br> ===Armor Research===<br><br> Subject -&gt; Enclave Armor<br><br> Researcher -&gt;T.

P. Smith<br><br> Analysis -&gt; Why am I researching such old technology? Practice, practice, practice, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, the Minigun uses a much smaller round than most of the rifles found throughout the Wastes. However, the rate of fire of the Minigun makes up for the small, 5mm round, sending a hail of bullets toward its target. Its shear size, coupled with its trademark sound, is enough to send anyone in its path running for cover. It's a great weapon for suppressing fire, letting others flank the unsuspecting enemy. A typical cartridge holds around 100 rounds.<br><br><strong> Research Note - Missile Launcher</strong><br><br> ===Weapons Research===<br><br> Subject -&gt; Missile Launcher<br><br> Researcher -&gt;J.

In fact, this is third one I've \"broken\" in the past month. I will pass the task on to L. J.

Toss up the gem!\"<br><br><br> The wizard's brow furrows. \"Got things a bit out of order, have I? Come back when you've got a powerful gemstone. Soon - I've never got to fulfill a prophecy before!\"<br><br><br><em>Talk to the wizard</em><br><br><br> \"Hoo-hoo! The slayer of Grelok approaches, raw stone in hand, just as I've seen!\" The wizard's pointy hat bobs excitedly as he points a finger at you. Suddenly, a pale orange arc of light extends from the knobby finger and draws the gemstone from your bag before you can react. The gemstone halts and hovers in the air before the wizard's nose.<br><br><br> \"Essence be true, powers renew, Fatty-Hoo-Do!\" With that, he slaps the hovering stone, smashing it against the smooth stone of the tower. In a burst of light, the stone splits into two, and one lands in each outstretched palm of the hopping little wizard.<br><br><br> \"Shard for the sword. Wrap her in iron and she'll find Grelok's black heart for you. Take the chaff, too. You'll need payment for a smith to forge the weapon.\" He tosses the stones down which you leap forward to catch safely.<br><br><br><em>Talk to the wizard</em><br><br><br> \"Get you to a smithy! Forge the shard with sword, and defeat Grelok!\"<br><br><br> The wizard tosses some pebbles down to shoo you away and busies himself conjuring colored puffs of smoke.<br><br><br> &gt; You acknowledge the wizard...<br><br><br><em>Talk to the wizard</em><br><br><br> The wizard is shooing you away, his sleeves flopping about.<br><br><br> \"Go!

You present him with the decapitated zombie head from your bag.<br><br><br> \"Praise you!\", he hiccups. \"Perhaps Grelok's influence isn't so strong!\". With that, he turns his decanter over on the head and tosses into a fireplace, where it bursts into purple flame and burns up almost instantly.<br><br><br> \"I must gather the faithful.\" He presses a brass key into your palm, \"Please, help yourself to what little may be of use at my chapel.\"<br><br><br><strong> Speak with the priest</strong><br><br><br> The priest is drinking water, poring over a thick, leatherbound volume connected by a thick leather thong to his neck. He notices you only when you've come very close.<br><br><br> \"Ah, good friend! Have you gone ahead to open the chapel? My body still aches with drink, I'm afraid, but soon I will gather the congregation and return myself.\"<br><br><br><strong> Go North</strong><br><br><br> &gt; You walk to the north...<br><br><br><strong> Go East</strong><br><br><br><strong> (Chapel) Look Around</strong><br><br><br> You stand at the end of a dirt path, facing a small chapel.

You grit your teeth and swing a mighty two-handed blow, the magical blade ringing clearly, even amid the tumult of throaty cackling.<br><br><br> You swing the sword so fiercely, it escapes your grip and hurtles into the open maw of the monstrosity, lost from sight in the arid darkness of Grelok's throat. You step back as Grelok jerks his mouth shut and stands upright. He is still for a moment, then starts clawing at his neck. Muffled, a ringing can be heard as if from a great distance.<br><br><br> Suddenly, Grelok's chest bursts in a fount of viscous, green blood. The Ringing can be heard clearly now, and as thick lifeblood oozes around the protruding tip of the magic sword, the stormclouds swirling the peak are already clearing.

Megaton is a fortified outpost of \"civilization\" (of sorts), but it seems that Giant Ants are the least of the dangers of this new world.

Of course, due to time and monetary constraints, not every vault will be equipped with a G.E.C.K. module.<br><br><strong> View External Contact Report</strong><br><br> The Vault recently received unexpected radio contact over the governmental Vault-Tec frequency, from an organization calling itself \"The Enclave.\"<br><br> Governmental codes are valid according to the Vault's ancient records, and The Enclave put forth an offer of amnesty and unity with the official remnants of the American government, in exchange for access to the Vault and its data stores. They claim that our Vault passwords no longer match their records, preventing them from extending their offer in person.<br><br> After brief negotiation, I have refused entrance to this \"Enclave.\" I cannot trust my Vault and its inhabitants to an unknown factor, much less one that would so gallantly suggest abandoning our vault's great mission.<br><br> All the more reason to prevent the rebels from opening the Vault to the likes of them.<br><br><strong> View Security Dossiers</strong><br><br> <strong>Rebels</strong><br><br> An alliance of rebels has formed in my Vault, dedicated to the wholly destructive goal of re-opening the Vault to the outside world. Amata and Edwin Brotch are the leaders of the band, with those ridiculous Tunnel Snakes making up its muscle, along with a handful of other youths and naive idealists.<br><br> Attempts to isolate and demoralize the group are proceeding apace: Edwin Brotch has been jailed for his attempt to lead a direct attempt to open the Vault's door, and their members have holed up in the old clinic and schoolroom. Their dwindling food and proximity to the dangerous \"Dr. Andy\" are sure to drain the morale from their rebellion, until they give up and are welcomed back into our happy family again.<br><br> <strong>Amata</strong><br><br> It pains me dearly to know that Amata is behind the rebellious element in my Vault. If she weren't their leader, it would be a simple matter to break their spirits and bring them back in line with the Vault's time-proven isolation plan.<br><br> But with her as a central figure in their rebellion, I must refrain from the more persuasive tactics at security's disposal. I will not repeat the mistakes of that night again. The Vault cannot afford it, and I cannot bear to drive my daughter further away from me.<br><br> Despite everything, I take great pride in her natural talent for leadership. When she inevitably comes around, I feel she will make a worthy successor to the position of Overseer.<br><br><h1> Vault 101 medical data system</h1><br> Remember: Medical files are confidential!<br><br><strong> Patient Files</strong><br><br><strong> Freddie Gomez</strong><br><br> Freddie's VDS is getting worse. Most days, he can't even get out of bed. When he does manage to function, Freddie hides his insecurities and low self esteem behind a bully's mask.<br><br> Vault-Tec medical protocols dictate the prescription of anti-anxiety medication when Vault Depressive Syndrome is involved, but do I really want to string the kid out on Chlorpromazine for the rest of his life?<br><br> <strong>Stanley</strong><br><br> Stanley continues to suffer from severe and chronic head pain. I've been feeding him aspirin like it's candy, but I'm reticent to give him anything stronger. He blames the lighting in his quarters, and though eyestrain is certainly compounding the problem, the headaches are actually a symptom of overwork and lack of sleep.<br><br> Knowing Stanley -- and the schedule the Overseer has him on -- the problem isn't likely to get better anytime soon. So it's aspirin, indefinitely.<br><br><strong> Amata</strong><br><br> Once again, the Overseer has insisted on being in the room for Amata's examination, throwing any inkling of doctor-patient confidentiality right out the window. I know he doesn't trust me; he never has. But I honestly believe the reason he attends his daughter's medical appointments is because he doesn't trust her. That's as ridiculous as it is sad. Amata's a great girl, and the chance of her doing something stupid - pregnancy, syphilis, whatever - is so unlikely it's not even worth mentioning.<br><br><strong> Experiments</strong><br><br><strong> Experiment 27CE</strong><br><br> The cells are still replicating normally.

It's not much, but considering what I have to work with it, a definite step in the right direction.<br><br> But this new experiment was also monumental for another reason: it's the first time Jonas has assisted me.

With some work, we may be able to move this workstation closer to where our research has been taking place. Must keep an eye out for a portable source of power. Must remember to translate my notes onto this thing when I have some time to do so.<br><br> While Jason was scavenging the ruins, I caught a glimpse of the group by the pool in the afternoon. Contrary to what most people think, they don't fear the daylight at all, but they do seem to prefer indoor habitats.<br><br><strong> Day 51</strong><br><br> Day 51:<br><br> I've conducted an informal experiment this week. I've filled some heavy basins with water, each with different levels of radiation. Consistent with my predictions, they seem to prefer water with high rad content. Thanks to these radiation suits, I was able to irradiate one of the basins with a typically lethal level of radiation, and to my amazement, this has worked better than any of our attempts at constructing a lure to attract them into our research area. This is very exciting!<br><br><strong> Day 53</strong><br><br> Day 53:<br><br> Jason's recovered and repaired a generator, which should allow us to move this terminal and some of my equipment out to a better position for observation of the group's behavior.<br><br><strong> Day 58</strong><br><br> Day 58:<br><br> Amazing! Today I was approached by one of them. I've decided to call her \"Melinda.\" I'm not actually sure if there's a way to establish gender, but Melinda moved in a way that appeared very feminine to me. She caught me off guard while I was checking water levels in the experimental basins. For a moment there, I wished I had taken that damned pistol Jason insisted upon me carrying. She grasped my arm, but instead of attacking, she appeared to sniff my arm where some of the scavenged resin I've been using to irradiate the basins had spilled on my suit. Moments later, she was gone. Must consider some way of tagging them.<br><br><strong> Day 63</strong><br><br> Day 63:<br><br> No sign of the group for days. Could Melinda have returned to the group with some news of our brief encounter? Perhaps they're scared of us?<br><br> Jason's beginning to get concerned, but I believe we're close to learning what we came here for. The poor man's been through Hell for me. I don't know if I could have achieved so much without him, but there's so much left to learn.<br><br><strong> Day 67</strong><br><br> Day 67:<br><br> I insisted on sleeping at the research site last night, much to Jason's protest. I'm sure I saw motion in the far ruins, but the moon had slid behind a cloud, so I couldn't make out for certain their shapes. I don't think mutants would have moved like that, and most people in the city know enough to hunker down at night. Could it have been our group, returning home?<br><br><strong> Day 68</strong><br><br> Day 68:<br><br> Slept outdoors again last night. Jason insisted on staying with me this time, and built a camouflage screen for us to sleep in. I irradiated the main body of water as heavily as I could to try and draw them out. My plan seems to have worked, because I saw few - I think Melinda was among them - come into the open at dusk and settle into the water. After dark, one I believe to be the alpha male - I've called him \"Samuel\" - emerged with the rest of the group. I had to switch my geiger counter off when he arrived to avoid being heard. I can't imagine the radiation levels the glowing ones must be infused with. I think that must be why he's the alpha - the others are so drawn to him because of his immense irradiation.<br><br><strong> Day 75</strong><br><br> Day 75:<br><br> I need to make contact again. I've coated my suit in resin, and will try approaching the group tomorrow at dusk. Observation hasn't revealed anything new; direct contact is required if I'm going to continue to learn about them. I know Jason would never understand, but this won't work if his suit isn't also irradiated. I'll coat it while he's gone scavenging during the afternoon, and we'll set up camp tonight by the water before dusk.<br><br> disconnect user: ISABELLA PROUD", "authors": "Isabella Proud"}, "22630": {"title": "Meresti Metro station terminal entries", "text": "<h1> The Family's terminal</h1><br> Use of this system is only by permission of Vance.<br><br><strong> The Five Laws of The Family</strong><br><br> <strong>The First Law</strong><br><br> The First Law \"Feast not on the flesh: consume only the blood.

In these fictitious stories the blood serves as both a food source and a center of power for the vampire. It is a common motif in these tales that a victim could become a vampire if bitten by one. Other noted attributes of the vampire are its ability to change into the form of a bat or wolf, to become gaseous at will, the ability to hypnotize the opposite gender and increased life span.<br><br><strong> Daytime Fear</strong><br><br> It is interesting to note that the vampire is traditionally regarded in literature as having an aversion to sunlight. Many people believe this may stem from the misunderstanding of common phobias such as photophobia and heliophobia or even the actual physical issue of photosensitivity. In all of these accounts, the subject withdraws from daytime activities and is rarely seen outdoors. In the 18th century, with medical science in its infancy, this commonly gave rise to ridiculous accusations by the uniformed that these people were \"strange\" or \"cursed\". This is likely the reason vampire are awarded this attribute to their stories.<br><br><strong> Vampires Destruction</strong><br><br> Depending on the cultural source, there are several ways to kill or destroy a vampire. The most common is by driving a wooden stake through the vampire's heart. In some cultures, the stake was driven through the mouth or stomach as well. Other tales tell of decapitation or immolation being the preferred method of destruction along with anything else that can completely annihilate the vampire's physical form.<br>", "authors": "Unknown[Fallout],Vance"}, "22631": {"title": "Office building (Seward Square) terminal entries", "text": "<h1>Workstation</h1><br> DC Metro Office of Urban Planning Human Resources Management System<br><br> You are logged in as Emily Weise Please make your selection:<br><br><strong> Submit time sheet.</strong><br><br> Time since last report: 72,982 days<br> Hours worked since last report: 0 hours<br><br> Our records indicate that you currently have an inadequate ratio of time worked to time passed.

It is clearly canis familiaris but generations of mutation have caused it to become its own new breed. An educated guess would place it as Canis Lupus or possibly Canis Indica. Even with the order's characteristically thick skull, the subject's brainwaves have been mutated, and territorial aggression amplified.

The subject's vesicle has mutated to match its enlarged hypodermic aculeus and the neurotoxin now acts on the potassium and calcium channels.

While much larger in size than generational ancestors, the local variety seems to have similarly low brain function, possibly due to an exceedingly tiny brain organ. Subject's incisors show increased enamel and dentine growth, making them razor sharp. Further study reveals extremely low levels of Substance P giving this subject an incredible tolerance to pain. I will take skin samples of my next subject as I believe the lack of Substance P can be spliced and manipulated for beneficial research, but this theory requires testing in a more fitting lab.<br><br><h1> Enclave Field Research terminal (Silo outpost)</h1><br> Welcome text<br> -***------- FIELD OPERATIONS<br> *-*-*------ ENCLAVE<br> -***-------<br> -----------<br> ----------- GOD BLESS AMERICA<br><br><strong> Field Entry: \"Bloatfly\"</strong><br><br> Kingdom: Animalia<br> Phylum: Arthropoda<br> Class: Insecta<br> Order: Diptera<br> Family: Tabanidae<br> Genus: Tabanus Linnaeus<br><br> Field observation suggests that the bloatfly is a mutation of the Tabanus horse fly with provocative advances. These evolutionary forebears possessed neither the significant body mass, nor projectile sting of the bloatfly. Dissection has revealed that this stinger is engorged with living pupae and neurotoxins. These projectiles are capable of incapacitating large prey on which the bloatfly and its gestating young can freely feed. These neurotoxins are only nominally effective on humans, but can cause localized necrosis at the wound site. This observation is contrary to earlier assumptions that the bloatfly was primarily a scavenger. The bloatfly can be dispatched easily with light weapons, but nonetheless present a threat to field operatives, especially when encountered in numbers. They are hostile and can strike before the target is aware of its presence.<br><br><strong> Field Entry: \"Brahmin\"</strong><br><br> Kingdom: Animalia<br> Phylum: Chordata<br> Class: Mammalia<br> Order: Artiodactyla<br> Family: Bovidae<br> Genus: Bos<br><br> The brahmin has been encountered both in domesticated and wild varieties. They are hardy animals, and their utility has made them valuable to humans, in turn allowing these animals to reproduce in quantities beyond what they would otherwise be likely to achieve. They are commonly employed as pack animals. In addition to having two heads, dissection has revealed that these creatures have eight stomachs, but otherwise do not differ significantly from their likely ancestors of the Bovidae Family. Typically docile in demeanor, these creatures are useful as both as beasts of burden and a food source for field operatives.<br><br><strong> Field Entry: \"Giant Ant\"</strong><br><br> Kingdom: Animalia<br> Phylum: Arthropoda<br> Class: Insecta<br> Order: Hymenoptera<br> Family: Formicidae<br> Genus: Camponotus<br><br> I've determined with near certainty that the aboriginal Ants are of the genus Camponotus. My best guess would be that a majority of the ants encountered are black carpenter ants (Camponotus pennsylvanicus). However, given that this particular genus consists of over a thousand different species, classification has been difficult. Prior generations of the genus were only considered a nominal threat to humans, but their social and fiercely territorial nature, combined with the greatly increased mass of current varieties has made them extraordinarily dangerous. The antennae of the ant is the primary sense organ, and soldiers report disabling this to be a successful tactic, as it sends the ant into a frenzy whereupon it attacks anything nearby, human or ant.<br><br><h1> Enclave Field Research terminal (Springvale power plant outpost)</h1><br><strong> Field Entry: \"Mirelurk\"</strong><br><br> Kingdom: Animalia<br> Phylum: Arthropoda<br> Subphylum: Crustacea/Chelicerata???<br> Class: Merostomata / Malacostraca / ???<br> Order: ???<br> Family: ???<br> Genus: ???<br><br> After going to enormous lengths to procure DNA samples of hypothesized forebears, we cannot explain why ancestry evidence is present from two vastly different creatures; the Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab) and the Callinectes sapidus (blue crab). It's obvious that a mutation occurred, giving this creature bipedal movement and massive growth, but I cannot explain the presence of multiple subphylum markers in DNA/RNA. Given their mystifying origins, I have decided the species deserves its own classification, and have thus dubbed them \"Scylla Serrata Horrendus.\" They can often be found in sewers and caves and should be considered hostile and very dangerous, as their chitnous shell provides excellent resistance to both firearms and hand-held weapons. They are disgusting creatures, and I cannot fathom their popularity as a food source among the citizens of the Wasteland.<br><br><strong> Field Entry: \"Great American Cockroach\"</strong><br><br> Kingdom: Animalia<br> Phylum: Arthropoda<br> Class: Insecta<br> Order: Blattodea<br> Family: Blattidae<br> Genus: Periplaneta<br><br> The insect colloquially known as the radroach is one of the most ubiquitous denizens of the modern American landscape. I believe it to be of the species P. Americana, the American cockroach, albeit a genome strain affected by years of exposure to heavy radiation levels. While winged, they are incapable of flight. I theorize that this is due to the evolutionary failure of the wing appendages to grow in strength commensurate to the surge in body mass. Radroach wings still seem to serve some purpose, however, in inter-species communication. Dark, damp, irradiated habitats, such as the metro tunnels, provide an ideal environment for breeding. Caution should be taken while exploring such areas, but the threat to operatives is minimal, even in great numbers.<br><br><h1> Enclave Field Research terminal: Camp RHO</h1><br><strong> Camp RHO Orientation</strong><br><br> DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY<br> RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT<br> FIELD OPERATIONS SECTOR, 693R<br> RRD-HG53-P R27-866-51<br><br> WELCOME:<br><br> 1.

This document defines the organization of the U.S. government and sets forth the rules and regulations, known as articles. In addition, there are modifications made to the articles by ruling Presidents during their reigns known as amendments. The society owns the only known copy of the document to exist which was retrieved from the ruins of the National Archives in 2256.<br><br><strong> Emancipation Proclamation</strong><br><br> The Emancipation Proclamation was a document issued by the breathtakingly charismatic President Abraham Lincoln in 1862. This executive order was the beginning of the end of slavery in the United States. Although it was issued during the Civil War, making it a war measure, it paved the way for the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution which completely abolished slavery once and for all.<br><br><strong> Gettysburg Address</strong><br><br> The Capitol Preservation Society is proud to have in its possession a copy of one of the most iconic and prolific speeches in United States history. This speech, given by the astonishingly intelligent Abraham Lincoln on Thursday, November 19, 1863, laid the groundwork for what would later become the basis of democracy in the United States and set the standards for a country with a government \"by the people, for the people.\"<br><br><strong> Monroe Doctrine</strong><br><br> The Monroe Doctrine was presented in 1823 by the average and unremarkable President James Monroe. The document warns the European powers of the time not to interfere in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere, citing the examples of colonization and puppet government as possible in tolerances.<br><br><strong> U.S. Declaration of War on Germany</strong><br><br> Part of our collection is a copy of the formal declaration of war made on Germany during World War II on December 11, 1941, by the government and endorsed by the President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While the document doesn't evoke the brilliance of other masterworks like the Emancipation Proclamation, it still served as a reminder to the world that the United States wasn't a power to be trifled with.<br><br><strong> U.S. Declaration of War on China</strong><br><br> Although it is uncertain when the Declaration of War on China was made (some say 2066 when they invaded Alaska, others say 2067 when the first power armor suits were deployed to counter their forces), it is the last known document of note authored by the United States Government before the bombs fell. Had the Declaration had the tenacity and might of a stronger President behind it, say Abraham Lincoln, who's to say what the outcome of those tremulous years would have been?<br><br><h1> Bannon's terminal</h1><br><strong> View Agenda</strong><br><br><br> Agenda for next council meeting<br> Fence on the flight deck.<br> Taxes.

It seems that the FEV wishes to \"level the playing field\" and start with a clean slate as it works.<br><br><strong> Entry 87-34233</strong><br><br> We've had a minor setback. Subject B440, Mary Kilpatrik, is now deceased. According to my autopsy, she died of a massive loss of brain function and was unable to sustain her basic bodily needs. This is the usual pattern we see in all the FEV Strains we test... the brains of the subjects becoming too damaged to support even the most basic human needs (eating, sleeping, etc.). So far, all other subjects are nominal and continue to exhibit physical changes.<br><br><strong> Entry 87-34265</strong><br><br> At ten days, we are now noticing that the skin of all our remaining test subjects is actually thickening and becoming more resilient. This seems to be the FEV bringing about some new adaptive change. This is the kind of result we were looking for... adaptations that could prove useful in combat situations. I need to remember to congratulate Dr. Filo on his skin engineering; his coded instructions in this strain seem to be exactly what he expected.<br><br><strong> Entry 87-34335</strong><br><br> Once again, I've hit that damn wall. At fourteen days, all of the test subjects began to exhibit severe bouts of rage and anxiety. So much so that they were a danger to my team and to this facility. I had no choice once again but to order them to be destroyed. It pains me every time we do this. The same cycle has been repeated in every strain we test. We always see superior physical adaptations, but the mental changes are their downfall.<br><br><h1> Lab Technician terminal</h1><br><strong> Notice #009</strong><br><br> Attention ALL Lab Technicians<br><br> The A Level Storage Room has been restocked with rad suits and other radiation dampeners. We were able to bring these up from deep storage for immediate use. Please only take what is needed (there is no need to hoard the items, there is plenty to go around) and to lock the door after you are finished.<br><br><strong> Notice #012</strong><br><br> Attention ALL Lab Technicians<br><br> The radiation expulsion ducts from the G.E.C.K. chamber are once again venting radiation directly into the area due to faulty seals. These seals MUST be properly maintained and checked on a DAILY basis. There is a clipboard with the maintenance checklist that you must initial when the check is complete in the main laboratory. Any lab technician skipping their check will be held accountable for their inaction.<br><br><strong> Notice #018</strong><br><br> Attention ALL Lab Technicians<br><br> Doctor Merrick has ordered the latest test subjects in the EEP to be terminated and then disposed of. Please make sure that: bodily remains are placed in the incinerator as soon as the subjects vitals are flat, the entire isolation room is disinfected and any relevant data on the subjects are given to Doctor Merrick. FEV is very unpredictable, and we do not want any contamination to remain when the next strain is introduced to new subjects.<br><br><h1>Cut Content</h1><br><h1> Vault 87 Overseer's terminal</h1><br><strong> View Security Dossiers</strong><br><br><strong> Dr. Wayne Merrick</strong><br><br> I'm told that Dr. Merrick is one of the brightest minds in the field of accelerated evolution, and apparently Vault-Tec agrees, because they've set up this Vault around him to suit all of his needs in the event that the bombs fall. All of his data and his work have been transferred to this facility from many important sources such as Mariposa Base, West-Tek and Vault-Tec Labs.<br><br> I like Dr. Merrick. He's driven without being careless. He knows that in the event of a nuclear war, he may be the only person left in the world that can advance human genetics beyond where they are now. He's meticulous, detail-oriented, and reports everything to me on a regular basis.<br><br><strong> Don Foster</strong><br><br> &gt; Data Corrupted<br><br><strong> Daniel Koster</strong><br><br> An excellent Maintenance Chief. Thorough, careful, and honest to a fault. In fact, that's becoming a problem. His security clearance isn't high enough yet to grant him access to all of the information regarding the FEV experiments performed by Dr. Merrick, but we may have to bring him into the fold soon. In the event we need major repairs on A Level, we'll definitely need his skills.<br><br><strong> Peter Stevens</strong><br><br> This gentleman continues to impress me. He was just recently promoted to Technician Third Class by Chief Koster for his ingenuity and ability to think quickly in emergencies. Given these talents, I think he'd make an excellent candidate for Koster's eventual successor if the need should ever arise.<br><br> UPDATE: It seems Peter has suffered some sort of a nervous breakdown. He keeps claiming that his \"son\" is missing and his \"wife\" is in deep depression, although I show no records of him ever being married or having a child. I've recommended that he be taken to the Test Labs for observation and sedation if need be.<br><br><strong> Richard Wyneski</strong><br><br> &gt; Data Corrupted<br><br><strong> Drew Mertinelli</strong><br><br> &gt; Data Corrupted<br><br><strong> View Scouting Reports</strong><br><br><strong> Mission Suspended</strong><br><br> I'm quite sad to report that due to a direct hit from what I presume to be a nuclear weapon on the entry area of Vault 87, we will be unable to provide the Scouting Reports as outlined in Vault-Tec's Operations Manual. The main door to Vault 87 is damaged beyond repair and we are detecting extremely high levels of lethal radiation outside and in the entry tunnel.<br><br><strong> Vault-Tec Instructions</strong><br><br><strong> Letter from Doctor Stanislaus Braun</strong><br><br> A Letter to the Overseer from Dr. Stanislaus Braun:<br><br> If you are reading this, emergency Vault internment procedures have been initiated and you and your control group have been sealed into your Vault. Congratulations! You are now a vital part of the most ambitious program ever undertaken by Vault-Tec.<br><br> If you have not yet read your sealed orders, do so now. They will outline the experimental protocols assigned to your control group. Please remember that deviation from these protocols in any way will jeopardize the success of the program, and may be considered grounds for termination by Vault-Tec Corporation (as outlined in your Employment Agreement).<br><br> Your Vault may or may not have been selected to receive a G.E.C.K. module. Please see Attachment A for details.<br><br> Doctor Stanislaus Braun<br> Director, Societal Preservation Program<br> Vault-Tec Corporation<br><br><strong> Attachment A</strong><br><br> Congratulations!<br><br> Vault 87 has been chosen as one of the very few select Vaults to receive a genuine G.E.C.K.

This mutation, it seems, disrupts the normal process of decay in the neurotransmitters along the spinal cord.\n\nSpecifically, the transmitters effected are those responsible for cardiac and respiratory function in a healthy human. According to my studies, these transmitters are continually regenerated after mutation, carrying sufficient oxygen to sustain the life of the subject while being insufficient to retain skin elasticity and avoid necrosis, the result of which is the corpse-like appearance of post-mutation humans. It should be noted that exposure to radiation typically result in sickness followed by death and the x-factor that will lead to mutation upon exposure in lieu of the typical outcome remains unknown to this researcher.\n\nIn the coming months, I will be assembling my findings on this subject into a full study.", "authors": "Barrows"}, "22784": {"title": "Earned your share", "text": "Nice job, Jiggs!\n\nI knew you&#39;d remember the good old days!

Maintaining personal safety during a Communist attack is a good example of proper usage of your standard issue laser pistol. However, rodent population control is an inappropriate use and subject to disciplinary action, as noted in Section 11.3.5.c.\n\nSection 28.1.1.b.1 - Maintaining Safe Conditions With the Laser Pistol\n\nUsing this laser pistol in the DCTA Metro facility can be beneficial in many ways, but the operator must observe his or her surroundings before deciding to fire. The subway utility pipes often serve as conduit to transport highly flammable gasses. Firing the laser pistol in the presence of a gas leak could cause an undesired explosion and/or severe personal injury.\n\nSection 28.1.1.b.2 - Operating the Laser Pistol Within Proper Specifications\n\nIt is required that all DCTA Employees keep the laser pistol pulse energy, length and repetition rate within the specifications diagrammed in the Laser Pistol User&#39;s Manual.
