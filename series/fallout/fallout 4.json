This one is called \"The New Squirrel\". Come with me on this magical adventure. There once was was a young squirrel named Ricky who lived in a big oak tree in a city park. Ricky was a brown squirrel and lived in the oak tree with all his brown squirrel friends and family. Every day, Ricky would look out from the top of his tree and wonder what kind of squirrels lived in the other trees. The older squirrels warned Ricky that the squirrels in other trees were thieves and liars. They were never to be trusted. Ricky had a rebellious heart and would not form his opinions based on anecdotal evidence. End of holotape.

One night, a red squirrel appeared at the bottom of Ricky's oak tree and woke Ricky and his family. \"Oh please help me.\" said the red squirrel. \"I am lost and I have nowhere to go.\" The elders were quick to turn the red squirrel away, but Ricky scurried down the trunk of his tree and stood firm next to the Red Squirrel. He yelled up at the elder squirrels. \"How could you turn him away? Just because he is from another tree? He needs our help!\" Affected by Ricky's assuredness and determination, the elders agreed to take in the red squirrel. The red squirrel thanked Ricky for standing up for him. \"You won't regret this.\" He said. End of holotape.

The red squirrel made a sound that Ricky took for agreement, and the two squirrels curled up to sleep. Later that night, Ricky woke up to the sound of leaves rustling in the oak tree. He looked around. The red squirrel was gone! Ricky surveyed the landscape below and saw a pack of glowing eyes approaching the base of his tree. Cats! Ricky heard a voice from a nearby tree. It was the red squirrel! \"I'm sorry.\" he said. \"They were following me, and I couldn't bring them to my tree. They would have eaten my family!\" As the cats ascended the tree and began to devour Ricky's friends and family, Ricky reflected on his decisions.

The brain extractors were never made to operate at this capacity - I think they've been running around the clock for the last few weeks. We usually end up with a popped blade from slicing through a particularly tough skull, or the hydraulics in the pulling arm seize up when the spinal cord isn't fully severed and the brain is pulled too early. I hope that Ciroletti doesn't yell at us again - this really isn't our fault.<br><br><strong> Div03-BE-0112</strong><br><br> We all had a pretty good laugh around the extraction department today. Ansel tried mixing some fresh bio-gel with a little bit of grenadine and vodka and dared us all to drink it down. It turned out to be pretty good - kind of thick and sweet with just the right amount of kick. We came up with a little game to try and name the drink. A whole bunch of stupid ones came up of course, but we finally settled on the \"Extractor Sunrise.\" Too bad we can't share with the other departments, but the bio-gel costs like a thousand bucks a pint, and I don't think Ciroletti would appreciate us drinking down some of her budget.<br><br><strong> Div03-BE-0123</strong><br><br> Today was Halsti's birthday, so we made him a brain-shaped cake. Well, sort of. We actually just took one of the extracted brains and covered it with frosting. Of course, we didn't tell Halsti that - the look on his face when he bit down on the slice we gave him was pretty hilarious. It was a waste of a decent subject brain, but the prank was totally worth it! We really have some good times down here. I sincerely hope that they don't reassign anyone away from the department - we're working well together and our efficiency rating can't get much higher.<br><br><strong> Div03-BE-0138</strong><br><br> Wommack over in sanitation made an offhand comment that his job having to grab what was left of our test subjects and dispose of them in the furnace felt \"wrong.\" Then, not a day later, I was sharing lunch with some of the personnel from the assembly division and they asked me if pulling the brains from our test subject's heads ever bothered me. I told them that it didn't. I'm not sure why some of the people on this project are having problems with what we're doing.

The subject's dura turned some kind of a mottled brown color, and started to break down after only twelve hours in the solution.<br><br> Turns out, the bio-gel was tainted with sulfuric acid runoff from the dome polishing compound and a reaction was occurring when they met. Unfortunately, this subject is a total loss. We'll have to just write it off as bad luck and switch polishing compounds immediately.<br><br> <strong>Maintenance Issue 09008112-AB</strong><br><br> Maintenance Issue 09008112-AB<br><br> We're continuing to have issues maintaining cohesion between the neural interface and the spinal column nerve endings. The nerves reject the connections faster than we can rebind them. I know we were hoping to keep the spinal columns intact for the Robobrains, but it's obviously not going to happen.<br><br> I'd suggest we revert back to the original plan - the good old brain in a jar prototype. It will reduce the amount of life support subsystems significantly, as well as cut production time almost by a third. I'll submit my findings to the brass in Washington tomorrow.<br><br><strong> Maintenance Issue 09008777-AC</strong><br><br> Maintenance Issue 09008777-AC<br><br> We got the first batch of Robobrains back from testing, and they're a mess. Cracked domes, thrown treads, overloaded fusion piles, fried circuits - the list goes on and on.<br><br> This particular issue is troubling though. According to field users, some of the Robobrains are misinterpreting commands. The on-board brain seems to almost overthink these instructions and \"decide\" to rewrite them for efficiency purposes. Most of the time, this results in property damage or even a few civilian fatalities.<br><br> I've gone over every square inch of the faulty units and I can't find a thing wrong with them. I'm going to have to send this issue over to research and see what they can shake out. At least our department is in the clear on this one.<br><br><strong> Maintenance Issue 09009113-AR</strong><br><br> Maintenance Issue 09009113-AR<br><br> One of the Robobrains rolled off the line with a \"faulty\" voice module. When it speaks, it's speaking in reverse. This troubled me, so I had them shut down the line for almost eight hours while I checked the software for issues and then gave the audio output assembler a thorough diagnostic. I didn't find any issues, so I gave the all clear to resume assembly and marked it down as a glitch.<br><br> I have no idea what would cause such a ridiculous issue, but if you ask me, I think one of the guys upstairs thought it would be funny.<br><br><h1> Facilities management terminal</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> RB-2851: Facilities Management - Tony Delano<br><br> ***WARNING***<br><br> An Epsilon-VI Security Alert has been declared.

For the good of the Commonwealth, I've increased production. I won't allow my efforts to be destroyed by such criminal scum.<br><br> Somewhere in the Commonwealth, a true villain has risen.

Went fairly well when it came to detecting and scanning other robots in the area and determining if they were hostile or not. Following tests will be a bit trickier. I'm not even sure how to manage a live test right now. The whole idea kinda freaks me out. I've never intentionally killed anyone, and these bots are sort of built to do that...<br><br><strong>Robot Ally Testing Series 2</strong><br><br><br> Initial testing was brutal, but it's improving. The allies could detect and analyze the threat of a weapon pretty well, but once you have one in the hand of an innocent, they immediately designate them as hostile. I need some better detection methods. It's possible they'll miss some hostiles judging by appearance, but better safe than sorry.<br><br><strong>Robot Ally Testing Series 3</strong><br><br><br> I think I got it. Testing group was able to pick out the dummies I created based on clothing and hostile actions. I think I spent a good week on creating different scenarios. Now I just need a live testing spot... I really don't even want to think about it.<br><br><strong>Robot Ally Testing Series 4</strong><br><br><br> I did it. Live testing. I had a recon bot go out and find a Raider camp based on the specs I uploaded. Lucky for me, all these groups tend to have a consistent look to them. The allies went in, eliminated the threat, and even noted in the data that two lives were saved in the process.<br><br> While I'm really excited about the two lives saved... I'm not sure if I'll sleep tonight.

General Rawlings met with the representatives from General Atomics, Anna Karim and Gregory Adler. I firmly believe having the U.S. Military working side-by-side with these brilliant scientists will yield some amazing results.<br><br> Getting the government to work with private industry is going to be a challenge.

I've been watching the staff closely for any signs of compromise. Psych evaluations aside, many become risk factors when dealing with their own kind as subjects.<br><br> Military personnel didn't even flinch, but several concerning verbal arguments have broken out. It seems we're dealing with a lot of trickle-down when it comes to the department heads' critical nature of each other. Karim and Adler aren't even on site, but the way their people act, you'd think they were right there with them.<br><br> The following are being put on watch:<br><br> - General Atomics: Carson Samuels<br> - General Atomics: Maura Hauer<br><br><strong> Site Report 0.628-B</strong><br><br> Rawlings brought in Dr. Kara Asante today. Chief Scientist Ciroletti is very excited to be working with her, but our cyber-robotics technician seems a bit put off. I think Mr. Samuels may know his job is at risk.<br><br> He's been more compliant lately. Maybe the realization of what it would take to safely leave this project has sunk in.<br><br> And I've just been informed that an extremely irate Gregory Adler is on the phone.

I thought it would be exciting to sign up and work for the robotics program, but when I finally got my departmental assigment, I almost quit. Power Substation A? Are you kidding me? Four years of electrical engineering school and they have me babysit a bunch of generators? I can strip a Mr. Handy or Protectron down to its base parts in under two hours, and they stick me here. What a goddamn waste of time.<br><br><strong> Log 080: Cunning Plan</strong><br><br> After talking to Sharpley during my smoke break, I thought of a way to turn my isolation into an advantage. I've got a buddy in the civilian service who works for a vending company and he reckons that I can make a few bucks if I stick one of his cigarette machines down here. It would save everyone a trip all the way to the surface if they're out of smokes and give me an excuse to say hi to any of the ladies that happen to wander in to purchase some. I'll tell you, Sharpley's a goddamn genius. I might even have to comp him a few free packs for his help.<br><br><strong> Log 082: Substation B</strong><br><br> I took all the trouble to sneak that machine into my substation, just to have Banks over at Substation B start complaining about the smoke. At first I thought he was just jealous that all of the ladies have been hanging around my new cigarette machine during their smoke breaks. Then he showed all his cards when he told me he's going to \"lodge a formal complaint with Delano\" if I don't \"make him happy.\" He doesn't care about the smoke, sneaky little theif just wants a cut of the cigarette sales. I might have to pay him off to keep the brass of my back.<br><br><strong> Log 090: Official Approval</strong><br><br> Finally got official approval to keep the cigarette machine in my substation. I'm pretty sure the free cartons that found their way onto the General's desk may have had something to do with it. Now Banks can't do a damn thing about it and he isn't getting a single penny.

Far Harbor and the Children of Atom are at the brink of warring with each other, and we're caught in the middle. It's the Fog Condensers. We just wanted to protect those people from being wiped out by the Fog, but the Childen of Atom think that's an affront to their god. They want the Fog to spread all over the island, specifically Far Harbor. And the people of Far Harbor hate them right back. They blame the Children of Atom for spreading the Fog, even though that's scientifically unlikely.<br><br> If Confessor Martin was still in charge of the Children of Atom, we might have better chances. DiMA and the old Confessor go way back. Martin was the one that found DiMA in the old submarine base, and when Acadia was founded, it was DiMA who gifted Martin and his followers with the base to serve as their new home. They renamed the base \"The Nucleus\" and we were originally excited to be working together, making the island a safer place for everyone.<br><br> But now Confessor Martin has disappeared, and High Confessor Tektus has taken charge. He's a dangerous megalomaniac who wants to destroy Far Harbor at all costs, and he's been threatening us to help him.<br><br> Worse, DiMA left behind his original memory banks in The Nucleus when he left to found Acadia. He blames himself for his lack of judgment, but he's too hard on himself. The Children of Atom were our firends back when Martin was in charge, and those memory banks would have been difficult to transport. DiMA had plenty of reason to believe they would be safe locked behind the prewar defenses that Martin promised to never tamper with.<br><br> DiMA has been on this island more than a century. Anything could be in those memory banks. If the Children of Atom find a way to access all that data, they could find something that would threaten the whole island.<br><br> We're running out of time. I've convinced DiMA that we need to send someone to get his memories back. Interfacing with DiMA's offloaded data won't be easy for someone else, so we're working on a computer program together. The program includes a set of instructions that DiMA is going to make to help our agent once they're inside the simulation. It'll also need tools to hack through the internal security protocols that the memory banks have.<br><br> I think we should send Chase, but DiMA thinks that's too risky.

Mark and I are working on building a temporary ramp for his wheelchair till Matthew can get a permanent one installed. On the plus side, I guess you could say the launcher was a success, so we may be able to get our league champion back on the lane after all!<br><br> After a few more tweaks of course. ;)<br><br> Daisy Davis, Asst. Manager<br><br><strong>10/19/2077 - Closed until further notice</strong><br><br><br> Closed until further notice<br> Date: 10/19/2077<br><br> The structural engineer says the building is unsafe but she won't know if it can be repaired or if the whole building has to come down till the debris is cleared out. I'm talking with the insurance company to see if there is any sort of emergency wages we can get for you but they are fighting me pretty hard. I'll gather up as much as I can out of your lockers and bring them and your final paychecks to the coffee shop tomorrow at noon. I've added a little extra to your checks, I wish it could be more, but it's all I've got till the insurance pays out. Mark, Daisy and I will give you all references if you need to find other work. I don't know how long the lanes are going to be closed, but don't think we're giving up. We'll do a fundraiser or something if we have to, and when we reopen, we'll be happy to have any of you back.<br><br> Matthew Stevens, General Manager<br><br><h1> Terminal (office)</h1><br><strong> No luck with the ball return</strong><br><br> Okay, so Mark and I had to scrap the lane return launcher idea.<br><br> Getting the wheel up to the speed we wanted was just sanding flat edges into the balls that threw off the balance and was ruining them. We were talking with some of the old timers and Jacob said we should just get one of them Fat Man catapults and use that. So we talked to a guy, who knew a guy that knows a guy. Cut to the chase, we're out a couple tanks of gas, but we found one at an old surplus center out in the willywacks. Not sure if it's entirely legal, but hey we're only gonna kill pins with it, so what the hell right?<br><br><strong> That was close!</strong><br><br> So first the good news. The launcher is working. We were having trouble with the balls getting caught in the launch tube, but shaving down the polyurethane on the balls a smidge and putting a fresh coat of wax polish on it has it launching them wicked fast!<br><br> The Bad News is that we forgot to reduce the tension springs and the first ball we launched flew straight through the wall of the office and stoved-in a table in the dining area! Damn near took out Mr. Clark with it! Knocked him clean outta his chair. We'll have to tune the power down a bit before giving it to Thomas. Also every ball he uses will have to be altered to work with the launcher, but it shouldn't be too hard to do.<br>", "authors": "Daisy Davis,Mark Wilson,Matthew Stevens,Thomas Davis,Unknown[Fallout]"}, "23596": {"title": "Vim!

He said that he hadn't even spoken to her and she just cold-clocked him out of the blue, but she told a reporter that he grabbed her. He's got witnesses that agree with him, but it's not playing well in the local news.<br><br><strong>Escape to Adventure</strong><br><br><br> Rollout of the Escape to Adventure branding so far has met with very good success. Market studies are showing that 87% of test group subjects feel \"Excited\" and \"Intrigued\" by the print ads. 56% said they would be likely to buy a bottle of Vim after seeing these ads. We're still having trouble developing a name for the female figure, which could help in audience branding recognition. Casting has stalled as well due to problems with finance.<br><br><strong>Captain's Blend</strong><br><br><br> Test Formula 10784, tentatively branded as \"Captain's Blend,\" has been a far bigger success than we could have imagined. Despite initial protest by the R&amp;D team at our request for a drink that captured \"The taste of Maine\", the test formula they have developed seems to be very popular with tasters. Very strange considering the #1 term used to describe the flavor so far has been \"fishy\".<br><br> Mr. Reed has still held back on a full rollout, but we have convinced him to try a regional testing distribution.<br><h1> </h1><h1> R &amp; D terminal</h1><br> ==================================================<br> = Research and Development =<br> = Test Kitchen =<br> = &lt;User \"Iris Mason\" signed in&gt; =<br> ==================================================<br><br> <strong>User Logs</strong><br><br> ==================================================<br> = User Logs =<br> = &lt;User \"IMason\" signed in&gt; =<br> ==================================================<br><br><strong>The Taste of Maine</strong><br><br><br> I really can't believe this. Marketing wants me to develop a new drink, but all they've given us to go on is \"The Taste of Maine.\" I swear to god, Norman just thinks that if he can string a few words together things will just magically appear. What does it even mean!? Fine. They want the taste of Maine, then that's what we'll give them.<br><br><br><strong>It's actually not terrible</strong><br><br> After firing off a couple of angry letters, I decided to to try to show them just how stupid this idea was. We took bottles of Vim classic and brewed it up with fiddleheads, lobster shells, and a couple other extracts and I was sure this was going to be absolutely disgusting. The thing is, it definitely taste kind of weird, but it's actually not as terrible as I thought. Maybe if we work on the flavor profile a bit... cloves or Aster extract... What the hell, we can try taste testing it. At least it will keep them off my back while I figure something else out.<br><br><strong>So this is really happening</strong><br><br><br> I just got the label proofs from Mr. Reed. They are actually going forward with this crazy thing. Despite taste testers saying it has a \"fishy\" taste, they seem to actually be liking it. The Aster extract seems to cover up the aromatics of the lobster... somehow. I really can't explain why anyone likes this thing.<br><br> Apparently they are going to call it Captain's Blend. At least for now.<br><br><strong>Well that's weird</strong><br><br><br> Some of our taste testers have reported having weird smelling sweat after drinking Captain's Blend. I mean I'm not really surprised, there is a looot of lobster in there. But it get's weirder than that.<br><br> One of the testers said that he's a commercial fisherman, and just loves the taste. He's been buying cases of the testers to bring out on his boat. The weird thing is that he claims that when he's been drinking Captain's Blend, the lobsters seem less prone to attack him when he takes them out of the cages. It sounds ridiculous, but I mean, what if it was actually true?<br><br><strong> Internal Mail Relay</strong><br><br> ==================================================<br> = Internal Mail Relay =<br> = &lt;User \"IMason\" signed in&gt; =<br> ==================================================<br><strong> [DReed] - Just do your best</strong><a href=\"http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vim!_Pop_factory_terminal_entries?action=edit&amp;section=64\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D\"></strong></a><br><br><br> Sender:[DReed]<br> &gt;&gt; Just do your best<br><br> Iris, I know it sounds stupid, but Norman knows this business.

Mostly I just stood there watching as Grun smashed his way through their camp. I don't know why we're doing it any more. There's plenty of hunting on the island, but when I brought it up to the others they threatened to kill me if I turned weak like one of the humans. Grun took a swipe at me, but he's slow enough that I was able to dodge it.<br><br><strong> I'm getting out of here</strong><br><br> I've figured out a plan.

No matter how brave, or how strong we actually are, the people of the Commonwealth have known Fear.\n\nEver since the &quot;Broken Mask&quot; incident of 2229, right here in Diamond City, when the first human-looking synth infiltrated and attacked a group of innocent settlers, we have lain awake in bed at night, terrified of the Institute and everything it represents.\n\nLong have we dreaded the possibilities: Will someone I know be taken in the night for who knows what reason? Will one of my loved ones suddenly turn on me, because they are, in fact, a synth replacement? Or will the boogeyman finally step out of the closet and devour all who stand in it way?\n\nWe, the people of the Commonwealth, remember the past. We live in terror in the present. But must we also fear the future?\n\nIn an almost unthinkable series of recent events, the Institute has destroyed anyone in the Commonwealth who could conceivably stop them, including longterm player the Railroad, as well as the newly arrived Brotherhood of Steel. What&#39;s more, the shadowy, sinister organization has completed work on an advanced nuclear reactor that will provide them with nearly unlimited power for the foreseeable future. This surely means greater underground expansion, as well as increased range of their teleporter technology (which, until recently, had been a closely-guarded Institute secret).\n\nSo what exactly does this mean for the Commonwealth, going forward?\n\n&quot;Nothing good&quot; seems to be the consensus. In fact, most people assume the worst.\n\nBut isn&#39;t it possible these fears are unfounded? The Railroad may have opposed the Institute, but they also defended all synths - even those who would potentially infiltrate human society. And the Brotherhood&#39;s mighty airship may now lie a smoldering wreck - but was the neo-knightly order really interested in the Commonwealth&#39;s best interests anyway?\n\nBut perhaps the most compelling reason not to give up hope just yet is the fact that, if my sources are correct - and I know they are - the Institute is now under direct influence of someone many of us have already met - the Vault Dweller. That lonely figure who came into our settlement searching for a missing child, and clearly found something else entirely. And maybe, just maybe, the Institute is all the better for it.\n\nSo be wary as we go into a new tomorrow, my friends. But stay strong. And always, always remember that humanity lives and dies on the surface. Humanity IS the Commonwealth.

We all eat them. We all love them. And Diamond City&#39;s Power Noodles has supplied this sustenance for the past fifteen years. From the stilted mechanical cadence of Takahashi&#39;s programmed Japanese, to the fragrant steam that wafts from each bowl, to the scalding tang of each delicious mouthful - the ordering and eating of noodles is but one of many shared human experiences. Or is it?\n\nI was struck by this very question as I sat at the counter of Power Noodles last Wednesday night, just after 5:00 pm, enjoying a dinner I had so many times before. That&#39;s when I noticed our very own Mayor McDonough sidle up to a stool, and engage in the very same ritual. Right hand extending. Mouth opening. Teeth chewing. Yes, eating noodles. The shared experience of almost every Diamond City resident.\n\nSo it must have also seemed to the residents of Diamond City nearly sixty years ago, on an uncharacteristically warm May evening in 2229, as they sat around this very same counter. But that was before the days of Takahashi and his noodles, when the bar served not noodles, but ice cold Nuka-Colas, frothy beers and stiff shots of whiskey. The barman&#39;s name was Henry, and that night, he facilitated the shared human experiences of drinking, smoking, talking and laughing. That is, until tragedy struck.\n\nThere aren&#39;t many among us who are even old enough to remember that evening - although some of the city&#39;s Ghoul residents certainly could have, had they not been forcibly removed, thanks to Mayor McDonough&#39;s anti-Ghoul decree of 2282. But there is one person among us who does remember, distinctly, the events of that evening: respected matriarch Eustace Hawthorne, who recounted her story in a Publick Occurrences exclusive interview.\n\n&quot;Oh, I was there all right. Sitting right at the bar, sure as you&#39;re sitting in front of me know. Twenty-two years old or so, and just looking to have a good time. I was safe behind the Wall - we all were - so what was the harm? And let me tell you, that Mr. Carter made it easy. He came into town earlier that day, said he was from out west somewhere. It didn&#39;t really matter. What did matter was his smile, and his laugh, and the way he&#39;d make everyone feel at ease. That night, at the bar, we all just sort of crowded around him. Everyone wanted to exchange a word, or hear about the state of the Commonwealth. And Mr. Carter, he was all too happy to oblige. It was just so wonderful. Until it wasn&#39;t.&quot;\n\nEustace continued her account of that evening, and the moment when things turned sinister, and the truth about Mr. Carter was revealed.\n\n&quot;We&#39;d been drinking, and carrying on, must have been three hours. Mr. Carter had four or five drinks in that time. He seemed a bit drunk, I guess, like the rest of us. Then something just sort of happened. He was smiling, but the smile sort of went from his face, all in an instant. And then his cheek started twitching, kind of funny. And I remember watching him, clear as if it happened just yesterday. He reached inside his coat, took out a revolver, and then &#39;Blam!&#39;- He shot Henry, the barman, right in the head. Didn&#39;t hesitate, didn&#39;t show any emotion- Mr. Carter killed Henry as casually as if he were paying him for a drink. But his cheek never did stop twitching. Let me tell you, all Hell broke loose after that.&quot;\n\nWhat Eustace is describing is, of course, is the infamous event known as the &quot;Broken Mask,&quot; when the people of the Commonwealth learned for the first time that the Institute, the shadowy scientific organization responsible for the creation of combat androids, had actually succeeded in creating a model so advanced, it could effortlessly infiltrate human society. Unbeknownst to the people of Diamond City, the Institute had somehow evolved their androids into true synthetic humans. Synths.\n\n&quot;After he shot Henry, that Mr. Carter shot three or four other people, too. Like I said, all Hell broke loose. The guards came running, they opened fire, and Mr. Carter he kept shooting, and throwing people around left and right. Finally, those guards put him down. Seemed like they had killed a man who had flipped his lid. Gone crazy. And he lay there like a dead crazy man, sure enough. God, it was horrible. But then we saw the plastic, and the metal- this was one of them early synths, you see - and we realized it wasn&#39;t a man at all. It was then we all knew. The Institute wasn&#39;t just &#39;out there&#39;. The Institute was everywhere now. Among us.&quot;\n\nIt was never determined precisely why the synth known as Mr. Carter went on his killing spree. Some suggested he had somehow been remotely controlled by the Institute, who wanted to test his combat effectiveness. Still others felt he had simply malfunctioned (a hypothesis supported by the twitching cheek), and was never meant to kill anyone. But at that time, the &quot;why&quot; hardly seemed important. What mattered was that the humans of the Commonwealth had been truly infiltrated by an organization whose intentions were, and still are, a complete mystery - using a model of synth even less advanced than the ones the Institute has in service today.\n\nWhich brings us to noodles. Specifically, the noodles consumed by Mayor McDonough last Wednesday night, in the same spot that Mr. Carter the synth went haywire, and mercilessly killed several people - after spending hours sharing an experience the people of Diamond City assumed was reserved for members of the human race. They were wrong.\n\nAre we?", "authors": "Piper Wright"}, "23704": {"title": "View from the Vault, Part 2", "text": "<strong>Note 2A</strong><br><br><br>View from the Vault Part 2 By Piper Wright<br><br> Continued from Part 1.<br><br> So what does &lt;Alias=Player&gt; have to say about seeing Diamond City for the first time?<br><br> \"Honestly, seeing everyone surviving out here?

No matter how brave, or how strong we actually are, the people of the Commonwealth have known fear.\n\nEver since the &quot;Broken Mask&quot; incident of 2229, right here in Diamond City, when the first human-looking synth infiltrated and attacked a group of innocent settlers, we have lain awake in bed at night, terrified of the Institute and everything it represents.\n\nLong have we dreaded the possibilities: Will someone I know be taken, snatched in the night for who knows what reason? Will one of my loved ones suddenly turn on me, because they are, in fact, a synth replacement? Or will the boogeyman finally step out of the closet and devour all who stand in its way?\n\nWe, the people of the Commonwealth, remember the past. We lived in terror in the present. But with the catastrophic explosion at the C.I.T. ruins quite obviously signaling the destruction of the Institute (which this reporter learned was actually located deep underground), the question on everyone&#39;s minds now is: has the boogeyman really been banished?\n\nIt would certainly seem that way.\n\nAs long as there&#39;s been an Institute, there have been those opposed to the shadowy, sinister organization. While most ordinary folk wouldn&#39;t dream of defying their merciless masters, the Railroad has waged a secret war against them for over thirty years. And the Brotherhood of Steel&#39;s arrival in the Commonwealth signaled the most overt opposition the Institute has ever faced. All empires must eventually fall. That said, perhaps it was never a matter of &quot;if&quot; but rather &quot;when.&quot;\n\nSo what exactly does this mean for the Commonwealth, going forward?\n\nThat, dear readers, is the question. For the boogeyman may indeed have been banished, but isn&#39;t it possible other monsters may step out of the closet to terrorize us in the night? There are other players in the Commonwealth. None had been as strong as the Institute - but that&#39;s sure to change. Will they work with the Commonwealth, or against it? Are they for the people, or against us?\n\nThis reporter hold onto hope, for one very specific reason. If my sources are correct - and I know they are - the Institute&#39;s destruction was actually orchestrated by someone many of us have already met - the Vault Dweller. It would seem that lonely figure who came into our settlement searching for a missing child actually found the monster that had taken so many children. And killed it.\n\nSo be wary as we go into a new tomorrow, my friends. But stay strong. And always, always remember that humanity lives and dies on the surface. Humanity IS the Commonwealth.

Off Cape Cod, aboard SS Wakeful.\n\nI&#39;m finally away. Emogene and Wilhelmina came to see me off, Emogene begging me not to go, as usual - poor girl, she takes these partings hard. Jack wasn&#39;t there, of course. He thinks I&#39;m making a laughing-stock of the whole family with these expeditions - has no time for what he calls &quot;ancient superstitions.&quot; No matter. This time I&#39;ll return with proof that even Jack will not be able to deny.\n\nSaturday, 10th February, 1894. In the Atlantic, aboard SS Wakeful.\n\nThe weather is fine and the captain promises a quick crossing to Lisbon. The red tape involved in organizing this expedition tried my patience almost to the breaking point, but I&#39;m sure it was better to obtain the necessary permits from the Omani authorities through the State Department. I can only hope that my sheaf of documents (and ready cash) will be enough to placate the local governor when I arrive.\n\nWednesday, 21st February, 1894. In the western Mediterranean, aboard SS Wakeful.\n\nSo far so good. Uneventful crossing. Metternich was waiting for us in Lisbon - with the welcome news that he had perfected his electrical sensing apparatus, which is now safely on board in its crates. If it works as well as he claims, this may save us weeks or even months of excavation work.\n\nMonday 5th March, 1894. Suez, Egypt.\n\nStill waiting to finish hiring our team of diggers. I am beside myself with impatience to be on my way - we are so close now - but I know from long experience that we will have better luck with an experienced Egyptian team than relying on the locals.\n\nWednesday, 14th March, 1894. Salalah, Oman.\n\nAt last! We docked yesterday have been unloading at a feverish pace. Any more delays and we will be in danger of having to postpone until the summer heat has passed.\n\nFriday, 16th March, 1894. Near Wadi Aydam, Oman.\n\nWe are on our way. Nothing more stands in my way but the impenetrable desert and the secrets of the ages. Ha! I welcome those challenges - they seem like child&#39;s play after the endless delays and paper-shuffling bureaucrats I&#39;ve had to overcome to get here.\n\nThursday, 29th March, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nWe have reached the spot without incident. Some superstitious grumbling from our local guide which I take to be a good sign. Tomorrow we see if Metternich&#39;s apparatus works. If not, we begin digging in the traditional way.\n\nSaturday, 30th March, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nMetternich&#39;s apparatus has been balky - sand in its delicate workings, no doubt - but he has obtained a favorable reading in a depression to the south. Heat during the day is tremendous. We&#39;ll set to work tomorrow and see what we see.\n\nMonday, 2nd April, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nNothing yet at the southern depression. Metternich swears that it wasn&#39;t a false reading. 2 more days and then I&#39;ll have to begin a search grid across the whole site, as disappointing as that will be.\n\nTuesday, 3rd April, 1894. Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nSuccess! Late this afternoon, the diggers struck worked stone. Apparently the edge of a large circular structure. More trouble from the guide - the wisdom of not hiring the diggers locally now even more apparent, as they pay little attention to him.\n\nFriday, 6th April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nI&#39;m now convinced we have found Ubar itself! We&#39;ve uncovered several fragmentary inscriptions, with runes that match the ancient texts. We&#39;ve made excellent progress clearing part of what appears to be a monumental plaza.\n\nWednesday, 18th April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nAll work has stopped - sandstorm, one of the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced. We are huddled in our tents in the lee of the one of the large outcroppings and must hope to ride it out. The darkness is complete although it is mid-morning.\n\nFriday, 20th April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nSandstorm continues for a 3rd day. Like nothing anyone has ever seen. The guide is becoming very troublesome - some of the diggers are beginning to listen to his wild tales of ancient curses and forbidden secrets. Even the normally phlegmatic Metternich is beginning to show signs of cracking under the strain.\n\nSaturday, 21st April, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nThe sandstorm is over, but two weeks of work has been undone - the area we had cleared is now buried under several feet of new sand. The guide disappeared in the night - I won&#39;t miss him, but the diggers are even more unsettled.\n\nThursday, May 3rd, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nWe&#39;ve located what must be the foundations of the Great Temple! So far nothing but stone and rubble, but something must have survived. Weather getting worse by the day. Metternich talking again of resuming work in the winter, but I won&#39;t hear of it. Not when we&#39;re this close.\n\nSunday May 13th, 1894. Ubar, Empty Quarter, Arabia.\n\nI must record everything, while it&#39;s fresh in my mind. Although it&#39;s hard to concentrate with the crown right here in front of me. It&#39;s almost unbelievable, even to me, that I hold in my hands an artifact so clearly not made by any human civilization. But let me set down how it happened as clearly as I can.\n\nWe had worked for at least a week to clear the shaft beneath the Great Temple - even the diggers had caught the excitement. Then we hit solid stone - a cyclopean block (series of blocks, as it turned out) obstructing the tunnel, clearly deliberately sealed by the builders. We almost despaired of getting through - 3 days of laborious pick-work - I wouldn&#39;t risk explosives here of all places! - then, breakthrough into darkness.\n\nI was first in - the dust of ages covered everything - clearly a burial crypt - sarcophagus at one end of the chamber. We lifted the lid, and inside - even I fell to my knees in shock. The diggers that were helping us fled; Metternich white-faced, I feared he was having a heart attack (luckily no).\n\nWe&#39;ll make a full catalogue of the tomb in the morning. I ordered it sealed up overnight - not that I really believe any of the diggers would dare to enter it again, but better safe than sorry. I removed only the crown, reverently, without disturbing the body or any of the other artifacts.\n\nAnd so - vindication! The crown waits gleaming as if new-made although I know it is older than any human artifact ever uncovered.\n\nLater:\n\nI know now that this city&#39;s name was not Ubar, and that this building as not a temple, and what was beneath it was not a crypt. I have so much to learn and so much to teach Wilhelmina, and Jack, and Emogene. When we return, we will return together.\n\nMonday, May 14th.\n\nMetternich was extremely surprised to see me wearing the crown this morning, and tried to argue with me when I ordered the men to bury everything we&#39;ve uncovered. It doesn&#39;t matter now. The sandstorms will erase all evidence that we were even here long before anyone can stumble across this site again. And the city&#39;s location is now safe with me until I can return and uncover more of her secrets - when I am ready.", "authors": "Lorenzo Cabot"}, "23782": {"title": "Orders", "text": "You stupid maggots!\n\nFirst your sergeant tells me you were caught drinking on base, then I find out a tank has gone missing!?

Pretty sure that's what caused the reaction to formula that he suffered. Killed himself seizing. Broke some of my equipment in the process. Will need to account for that in future batches. Don't want to have to replace this stuff again.<br><br> Just hope I didn't risk my neck sneaking into the far reaches of the Galactic Zone for nothing.<br><br><strong> Test Two</strong><br><br> Progress. Second \"subject\" was another heavy drug user (what else are we going to find around here?), but no seizures this time.<br><br> Spraying the target with the formula, however, doesn't seem to have made persuading her any easier. Now, once I injected it, I feel like she started listening more attentively, but it was hard to tell over the screaming.<br><br> On to test three, I suppose.<br><br><strong> Test Three</strong><br><br> Finally, some real results.<br><br> This subject was older. Female. In her forties. Looks like some kind of farmer or something equally awful.<br><br> Applied the gas and for a good minute, was able to get her to agree with a series of increasingly less reasonable suggestions. Hand me that pen. Take off your shoes. Take off your clothes. She balked when I asked her to start mutilating herself, but still, progress.<br><br> Going to have William prepare a room. I think our guest will be staying for a while.<br><br><strong> Test Four</strong><br><br> More general testing with Mrs. Farmer, who William's taken to calling Annette, after the janitor that \"disappeared\" back when we were all still living in Diamond City.<br><br> Progress continues, though I'm finding that persuasion is still crucial to getting what I want - if I can't sell why my demands are a good idea, there's little chance for my suggestions to take hold.<br><br> However, when offered correctly, I've managed to get Annette to put herself at greater and greater risk. Particular fun was when I succeeded in convincing her to pick the pocket of a Disciple in the market. Disciple managed to take a chunk out of Annette before I could intervene, but nothing some gauze and antiseptic couldn't patch up.<br><br> Made sure to give the Disciple's description to William. Can't stand it when people damage my toys.<br><br><strong> Test Five</strong><br><br> Decided it was time to run a real test of the formula. I'd order Annette to do a task outside the Parlor. Unsupervised. Give her the chance to run and see if she'd actually return.<br><br> First step was, of course, getting her in a state where she'd WANT to run. After a few days of pain, I gave her a dose and asked her to collect some ingredients for me from the market. All by herself.<br><br> Almost. William was watching from the rooftop, just in case she did decide to run.<br><br> And so we sat. A minute. Two minutes. Three. Waiting in the Parlor with Mags, I could see the disapproving frown start to edge in at the corners of her mouth. But five full minutes later, who comes limping back into the Parlor.<br><br> Lovely Annette. Arms full of exactly what I asked. Even set a new duration record for a single dose of the formula.<br><br> Now, unfortunately, the wounds she'd sustained during our \"prep\" ended up getting the best of her not long after, but still, we all knew a success when we saw one.<br><br><strong> Test Six</strong><br><br> After our positive results with Annette, Mags requested some broader testing.<br><br> First up - the market.<br><br> While perusing Maddox's stall, I let a canister slip out of my bag. Not sure if it was the noise, smells, or a dozen other possible issues, but the test went nowhere. Maddox responded to exactly zero of my demands. I was hoping I could finally do the whole park a favor and get him to cut off that ugly topknot.<br><br> Seems it was not to be.<br><br><strong> Test Seven</strong><br><br> More failure.<br><br> Mags wanted to see if we might be able to perhaps use the formula to get one of the local Brahmin trains to favor us with some additional supplies, but with no success.<br><br> Another scenario to cross off the list.<br><br><strong> Test Eight</strong><br><br> This batch had apparently gone bad without me realizing it. Got the bruises to show for it.<br><br><strong> Test Nine</strong><br><br> Finally, another success.<br><br> William brought me in another farmer, who responded much the same as Annette did. A thread to follow, it would seem.<br><br><strong> Test Ten</strong><br><br> And we have our results. Caravans, no. Markets, no.<br><br> But settlements, it would appear, are what this formula was made for.<br><br> Maybe it's the exhaustion brought on by manual labor, the bad water, but something about that environment, Annette's wretched environment, appears to favor the gas.<br><br> I decided I'd track my way back to test subject nine's little dirt pit and see what I could get to happen when I deployed the gas.<br><br> Before I knew it, I had them feeding me their winter stores, handing over whatever caps they had, and ultimately convincing them their Brahmin sty was better in my hands.

Believes deeply in the power of violence. Makes her a dangerous adversary.<br><br> - That said, has a penchant for justice among her own. Stole gang from previous leader by gaining their respect, rather than through graft or deception. Irritatingly hard to exploit people like that.<br><br> - Ultimately, acts as a stabilizing agent among the Disciples. Means Nisha's place in their hierarchy should not be tampered with. Dull, but the right move. Any other Disciple in that role would likely lead to utter havoc (Dixie springs to mind).<br><br> <strong>Nisha - Disciples (Defunct)</strong><br><br> <strong>Dixie - Disciples</strong><br><br> - True psychopath. Clever, devious, bloodthirsty. Suspect she's responsible for the death of at least three Operators since our arrival, very likely more.<br><br> - Takes and treasures souvenirs from her victims. Someone meddling with her toys might be able to get her to do something rash, should the need arise.<br><br> - Granted her current position by Nisha, probably to support the girl's vanity. Much less likely to turn on her boss if she thinks she's respected.<br><br> - Thanks to that, she does seem to honor Nisha's authority. Doesn't appear to have plans to claim leadership for herself. Best for all of us it stays that way.<br><br><strong> Dixie - Disciples (Defunct)</strong><br><br><strong> Savoy - Disciples</strong><br><br> - Nisha's enforcer. Fiercely loyal.

Displaced his two predecessors by tarring and feathering them, sending them out into the wastes.<br><br> - Pack law states members can only shame one another, never kill. Both former Alphas were never heard from again after being given the boot. Acquiring proof of their deaths could be useful leverage.

Now, though, just seems worried he's going to share Colter's fate if things don't get back on track. Not wrong. Undoubtedly moved on this new Overboss to protect his own neck.<br><br> - However, man genuinely does appear to believe that Nuka-World can be used to make us all rich.

I swear, those security guys need to be more careful with our specimens. Last time this happened, not only did one of the escaped buffalo end up with a broken leg, but the other died when security had the wrong dosage in the tranquilizer darts. I'll report my findings in my next entry.<br><br><strong> Journal Entry 09-19-2077</strong><br><br> Journal Entry 09-19-2077<br><br> I've had my third request for a budget increase denied due to resources being diverted to this \"Project Cobalt\" I am hearing so much about. I hope Bradberton realizes that Safari Adventure isn't just an amusement park, it's also home to several hundred living and breathing organisms which have unique food, water and environmental requirements. I've asked for more information on Project Cobalt, but I am continually met with denials. For all the trouble it's worth, this project better produce something big.<br><br><strong> Journal Entry 06-02-2077</strong><br><br> Journal Entry 06-02-2077<br><br> Thanks to Dr. McDermot's help, I've been able to isolate the segmentation issues I've been having with PB041. The Polar Bears on the last segment kept coming out of the Nuka-Gen Replicator inside out and then exploding. I assume this was due to an incorrect sequence, but I've never seen such a violent reaction from a specimen before.

It's only been a few weeks since they vandalized my Corvega by filling it with manure, and the Security Department assured me that would be the last time they were allowed anywhere near Nuka-World. However, I arrived at the facility today to find \"Stop the torture!\" painted across the security door. I don't know why these morons think we're torturing animals.

Woke up right next to the Nuka-Gen Replicator's main terminal and a program was running. It looks like I was trying to sequence an anteater with sixteen giraffe-type legs, scales, four eyes and two tails. Amusingly, even in my inebriated state, I've created a fairly viable specimen sequence that could possibly work. I don't think the animal would live very long, but my scientific curiosity says I should give it a try.

I have the correct samples of Jackson Chameleon and American Alligator in the mix, but keeping Sample Q334 stable continues to elude me. If I intend to create a guardian creature for Safari Adventure, it has to be able to listen to and comprehend my commands. I was hoping the brain cells from Q334 would do the trick, but I've seen failure after failure. I hesitate to throw the switch and see what happens. What if I can't control it? What if it ends up attracting more attention to the park? I think I'll check the sequence a few more times just to be sure.<br><br><strong> Journal Entry XX-21-999 (Date Out of Range)</strong><br><br> Journal Entry XX-21-999 (Date Out of Range)<br><br> While foraging for food and supplies today, I stumbled across the remains of an astonishing biological specimen. It was humanoid in appearance, but much larger. It had greenish-colored skin and roughly human features. It appeared to be wearing clothing, and had been recently killed by what looked like bullet wounds. After dragging it back to the laboratory, I began an extensive examination. My conclusion was that this was the genetic mutation of a human. I can only hope that whatever caused this remarkable mutation can be extracted and used for my own experimentation. I'm entering it into the record at Sample Q334.<br><br> <strong>Journal Entry XX-17-999 (Date Out of Range)</strong><br><br> Journal Entry XX-17-999 (Date Out of Range)<br><br> One of the two backup reactors for the laboratory died today. That leaves a single generator to run the facility's power. If that last reactor goes down, I may have to consider destroying the Nuka-Gen Replicator and abandoning the laboratory. Even though I could have already done this a long time ago, I realize that this machine could possibly be the last of its kind on earth.

We get to live in the Fun House! It's a ton of room, but every memory I have of this place involves someone getting nauseous from the spinning.<br><br> I'm glad he's happy about it at least, it's been far too long since I saw a smile like that on his face. I don't think he's realized it yet with everything that's been going on, but he would have graduated high school last month. I know it's selfish, but part of me is glad that the attack happened when it did so I can have my son here, safe with me.<br><br><strong>Out in the storm</strong><br><br><br> Woke up to find that Bradley had gone out in a radiation storm. He said he couldn't take living like this and if the radiation was going to kill us, he'd rather die quickly. I don't know if he'll ever realize how much it hurt me to hear him say that.<br><br> Luckily the storm doesn't seem to have hurt him at all. In fact, that ankle he sprained messing around in the spinning room last week seems to have instantly healed. Maybe whatever mutation the initial storms gave us has somehow made us immune to radiation. Thank goodness for that.<br><br><strong>Snapped during the attack</strong><br><br><br> Something snapped in me during the last attack on Kiddie Kingdom. Maybe it was pent up rage from Bradley leaving, but during the attack I lost it and bit into the neck of one of the attackers.<br><br> At least, that's what they tell me.

We've seen some large groups come and go. Usually we've managed to scare them off or use the radiation sprayers to get rid of them. Seems like most of the attackers are just terrified of the clown make up. It's kind of sad, they used to bring people so much laughter.<br><br> On the whole, things are good. We have plenty of food, water and even partial power when we need it, which I'd imagine is a lot more than most others have.

I'm glad Rachel is still alive, I think she's the only thing keeping me together.<br><br><strong>Can't sleep</strong><br><br><br> I can't sleep. We've had to board up another person today. That's over ten in the past year alone. I'm trying to keep everyone organized and keep everyone's spirits up since Kenneth, Mitchel and Herman are gone, but there are some days I just don't want to even get out of bed.<br><br> Some have even started talking about putting the Afflicted out of their misery, but we put a stop to that talk pretty fast. We've been here a long, long time now and these aren't just the people I survived the war with, they're our new family. We've got to find some way to help them.<br><br><strong>Was the real magic?</strong><br><br><br> There was a big attack today, and Dean got hit by a stray bullet. The thought of losing another of us caused me to snap, and suddenly it was as though energy was literally flowing from my body. Then Dean just shot up and gasped for air. I healed him, but I have no idea how.<br><br> After the attack, it hit me. Was this some sort of mutation... or was it real magic? I mean, given the circumstances, who could tell the difference? Even if we had a scientific explanation, does that really make it less magical? Regardless of what I want to call it, maybe I can use my \"powers\" to help the Afflicted.<br><br><strong>New neighbors</strong><br><br><br> Some big gang took out that group in Nuka-Town this week. The gang looks pretty aggressive, so we've decided to leave them be for now. It's too bad, we had almost decided to make contact with the traders there, but now it looks like we've missed our chance.<br><br> Rachel is talking about one or both of us breaking from the group to try find a cure somewhere else. But, if the two of us leave, I don't know if there will be enough leadership to keep this place together.<br><br><strong>After Rachel Left</strong><br><br><br> It's been over a year since Rachel left, and still no word. At home, there's nobody left. No one but me and the Afflicted, and that gang of Raiders next door. At first I was wishing that Rachel had stayed behind, but I kept coming to the conclusion that she did the right thing. No matter how much it hurt, she had to leave for the good of us all. Only problem is that I don't know how much longer I can hold the castle. The walls are crumbling. The walls are crumbling and I don't know how much longer I can hold them up.

I mean, I love acting but I still want to put that rather expensive organic chemistry degree to good use.<br><br> My boyfriend Oswald and the rest of the gang passed out here in the tower after they threw me a party. All of us got drunk and came up with this ridiculous plan to take over the park if the war ever got bad... like, nuclear bad. We all agreed, but instead of shaking on it, we did a round of shots. Here's to 2077, I hope it's a hell of a year!<br><br><strong>Moving on up</strong><br><br><br> We've got our defenses set up now and things are starting to look a little bit better. Thanks to my background, I've sort of become the unofficial doctor of our raggety little bunch. Oswald has been so supportive, and he's continued to manage this whole crisis like a real leader. I'm so proud of him.<br><br> Whatever that horrible radiation storm did to us, everyone is having bad reactions, but there are others literally dying from it. I wish I could do more to help everyone, but I'm an organic chemist, not a surgeon. I don't have the heart to tell people that as they're dying in my arms, so I just keep it to myself and try to give them hope.<br><br><strong>The Affliction</strong><br><br><br> My good friend Fran succumbed to the Affliction a few days ago and I've just been a wreck. Dean and Oswald boarded her up in a house before she tried to attack anyone which I don't think I could have taken. Oswald stayed the night up here and just held me while I cried. I tried to apologize to him for falling apart like this when he needed me to be strong, but I knew her since elementary school and I couldn't hold it in any longer. I hate this place.<br><br><strong>Magic is real?</strong><br><br><br> There was a huge attack this week that pushed us all the way back to the castle gate. Just when we were about to fall back to the theater, a bunch of the Afflicted started crawing out of their houses and started helping us out!<br><br> But as our attackers were retreating, my body froze when I saw a stray bullet hit Dean and it looked like he was dead. But, Oswald did... something. This glow came out of his body, flowing like a wave. Suddenly, Dean started breathing again! After the attack ended, we all looked at Oswald who started muttering something about using \"real magic.\" Most of us didn't know what to think. Me? I don't care what the hell you call it, maybe we can use it to cure the Affliction. Either way, I gave him a huge kiss for saving Dean's life.<br><br><strong>Leaving to find a cure</strong><br><br><br> We've tried everything we can think of, exhausted every option. Not even Oswald's \"powers\" can seem to stop the Affliction. There are only a handful of us left and we're running out of time. I don't know what will get us first, the Raiders who moved into Nuka-Town, or the Affliction.<br><br> So that's it. I've talked it over with Oswald and he is going to stay in Kiddie Kingdom to keep everyone safe while I go to find a cure. I felt awful leaving everyone behind, especially Oswald, but I really have no other options. I'm going to head over to the town of Bradberton near the park, and start there.

Shelton, Security Department<br><br> Sir, I've done as you've requested and informed all security personnel about our problems with the A.F.A.D. group. We're doing the best we can to keep them as far away from Safari Adventure as possible, but we're understaffed. I need every man and woman I can get, but you've assigned twelve of my people to Project Cobalt and have yet to replace them. Any help is appreciated, sir. Have a wonderful day.<br><br><br><strong>Outgoing Mail JCB871NWC</strong><br><br> To: Peyton Huxley, Executive Assistant<br><br> I've starting reviewing the Hidden Cappy contest details and I had a question. So, I actually have to receive the contest winners in my office in person? If so, have you considered how Project Cobalt could effect that idea? I'll do it for now, but we'll have to revisit the issue once my transfer is complete. Anyway, I promise you that I will submit the rest of my comments and changes this week. I've been too preoccupied with Project Cobalt, and I've definitely put it off for too long. Don't worry Peyton, if I take any longer, just tell the marketing team to come after me with the torches and the pitchforks.<br><br><strong>Incoming Mail KL332NWC</strong><br><br><br> From: Kate Leavitt, Beverageer Division<br><br> Sir, I appreciate your enthusiasm over the Quantum beverage idea, but I really think we should run more tests before we just send it out to market. The isotope that we're using is strontium-90, which is extremely radioactive. It's perfect for the military's applications but even with Rex's purification distilling process, it can be dangerous. Now, I know that the bright blue bottles will look wonderful on store shelves and we stand to make a lot of money with this product, but think of the long-term effects it can have. We already know it causes the imbiber's urine to glow, and while others in the Beverageer Lab find that amusing, I find something like that coming out of my body disturbing. I have a battery of tests I'd like to perform before we release the product to the Washington D.C. test market. All I ask is a six to eight month delay. I await your answer.<br><br><strong>Outgoing Mail JCB800NWC</strong><br><br><br> To: Peyton Huxley, Executive Assistant<br><br> Absolutely loved the \"Nuka Condolences\" Fruit and Cheese Baskets you sent out to the families of our early prototype Quantum flavor testers. Great idea. I think I loved the fine print of the health damage waiver you had them sign before they joined up even more. Saved us billions I suspect. You're at the top of your game Peyton, and maybe someday you'll be sitting in the big chair. For now, enjoy that shiny new Quantum Blue Corvega you found parked in your driveway this morning.

I already knew he was coming, my contacts in Washington D.C. saw to that. He asked for exactly what I expected: the use of Nuka-World's Beverageers for a military chemical and weapons program. I told him I'd do it if gave me the information on the military's LEAP-X (life Extension and Prolongation) program. The look on his face when I asked that was priceless. As expected, he said yes. The moment the LEAP-X data arrives, I'm putting a team to work on it right away. It's obvious that this world is headed for the end and I intend to outlast it all.<br><br><strong>08-27-2076 JCB</strong><br><br><br> 08-27-2076<br><br> I had Vault-Tec modify my personal vault to accommodate the machinery required to keep the LEAP-X system running. It's costing me a fortune and I've had to divert money from the amusement park, but who cares. My money and the park won't be worth anything when the world is a smoking ruin. I've flown a few of LEAP-X's researchers down here to make sure the prototype works. I bet they're glad to still have a job, seeing as all the military's money got diverted to wartime resources. I'm hearing complaints from my Nuka-World team about the cutbacks, but they'll just have make due.<br><br><strong>10-20-2076 JCB</strong><br><br><br> 10-20-2076<br><br> Meacham's work with Project Cobalt struck gold. His team came up with a custom isotope based on strontium-90 he's calling \"Quantum.\" He believes he can use the isotope to weaponize almost anything in the military's arsenal. He's come up with a few prototypes like the \"Nuka-Nuke,\" and we've even used the Quantum to enhance one of the military's power armor suits. Ironically, Meacham believes we can use this isotope somewhat safely as an ingredient in a new Nuka-Cola soft drink flavor. By reducing most of the harmful effects of the isotope, the Quantum will actually glow longer than the ingredients we use in Quartz and Victory. In fact, I've told Meachum to start distilling it immediately and call it \"Nuka-Cola Quantum.\"<br><br><strong>01-19-2077 JCB</strong><br><br><br> 01-19-2077<br><br> The original intention of LEAP-X was to create a living bio-suit to preserve my body after it would normally expire, but now I've been told by those idiots on the LEAP-X team that it's not possible. LEAP-X requires so much power and so many special components, it can only accommodate no more than fifteen pounds of organic matter. That leaves me no choice. If I want to prolong my life, I'll have to have them preserve only my head. I've told them to proceed. I haven't come this far just to give up and await the inevitable.<br><br><strong>04-02-2077 JCB</strong><br><br><br> 04-02-2077<br><br> This is my final entry. Today, I will be undergoing the surgical procedure to have my head removed and transferred into the LEAP-X system. If anything should happen, I've instructed Peyton Huxley, my Executive Assistant to handle my affairs.

Thank god we had The Plan, and everyone stuck to it. We couldn't talk sense into all of the park visitors, but we were able to grab a few out of the stampede and take refuge in the employee tunnels.<br><br> Oswald and Rachel did a pretty good job stocking up down here. We've got perserved food and seeds, water from the pump systems, tools, extra lumber. Just about everything really. Except for weapons... that was Mitchel's job and we don't know if he survived. We just gotta keep calm about this and ride it out.<br><br><strong>That crazy bastard</strong><br><br><br> It's been about a week since the bombs fell, and we'd all writen Mitchel off for dead. Then he comes rolling up in a semi half full of guns, explosives, food, medicine, chemicals, you name it! Said he'd been busy gathering the rest of what we'd need to fortify Kiddie Kingdom.<br><br> He had some blood on his shirt, but when Oswald started to ask him about it we all told him to just leave it alone. I mean, Mitchel's a crazy bastard, but right now I'd rather have him on our side. I certainly wouldn't want to go up against him! We blew up the service tunnel passages connecting to the other areas of the park.If things don't calm down in another few weeks, we'll head outside and barricade the gates.<br><br><br><strong>Radiation storms</strong><br><br> The fighting outside has died down a bit and we've barricaded the gates to Kiddie Kingdom. While we were finishing up, a weird storm started to blow in over the horizon to the east. We barely had time to finish up, and when it hit, it hit hard. I've seen all sorts of storms, but this one was different. Almost like a tornado with green lightning arcing through the sky. We all ended up taking shelter where we could, but a few people just got sucked into the vortex and were just gone.<br><br> We were trapped for hours while that crazy storm passed over. It must have picked up the fallout from Boston, because everyone has been sick for weeks now and quite a few have died. Those of us who haven't are... changing. The preparedness videos never said anything about this.<br><br><strong>Some sort of Affliction</strong><br><br><br> We've been alive here for over a hundred years now. The change has affected all of us. It seems as though our bodies have adapted to the radiation. Our features have become twisted and distorted, but we no longer felt ill. Unfortunately, it seems like this change has affected some of us worse than the others.<br><br> First it was Mitchel, now Herman. They aren't speaking any more and they seem to just shuffle around growling. If we try to hold them back, they start to get violent. We've tried everything we can think of. Talking to them, medication, every possible remedy for a cold or illness, but whatever this affliction is, we can't seem to beat it. Rachel's convinced that it has to be an illness of some sort, the rest of us just call it the Afflication.

It wasn't even a big group, and they weren't as well armed as we were. During the fight, I froze up when some grocery clerk charged Evan from behind. He was knocked to the ground and was about to have his head bashed in with one of those gumdrop decorations when Mitchel blew the clerk's brains out. Now Evan is pissed at me for not watching his back. The damn world has ended and I have to deal with a pissed-off boyfriend.<br><br><strong>Why is this happening</strong><br><br><br> It's been a few months since the radiation storms started. Twenty three people have died so far, and I'm starting to wish I was one of them. My skin looks like a prune, at least in the places where it hasn't fallen off. A couple of the others seemed to have stopped changing, but they look terrible.<br><br> Half of my hair has fallen out. Another clump just fell out while I was typing this. Evan's hair is gone entirely and I can barely stand to look at him. We had a huge fight about it and now he's moving his stuff out of here and up into the clock tower. I felt like a monster chasing him off, but maybe it's true. Maybe I am a monster. Maybe we all are.<br><br><strong>Contamination in the water</strong><br><br><br> Some sort of alarm woke us in the middle of the night. It looks like the water intake pipes are contaminated. I mean the water is practically glowing. The alarm must have been some sort of automated failsafe to protect the park. We'd all heard the rumors about Nuka-World having some sort of reactor in the Bottling Plant. God only knows what they put in that Quantum stuff. The heck with it, it's been over a year now, if the radiation from the storms hasn't killed me yet, what's a little bit more? I'm going back to bed.<br><br><strong>Found a use for the Sprayers</strong><br><br><br> We were attacked by a huge mob today. They almost made it to the castle this time. As we were trying to drive them back, I had an idea. We may be immune to radiation now, but these people probably aren't! I ran into the tunnels and turned on the park's water sprayers. In minutes, the attack was over. Man, we should have been doing this for years! When Evan heard it was me who figured it out, he kissed me until I couldn't see straight. I dunno if it means things are totally good between us again, but hell, I'll take it!<br><br><br><strong>The Affliction is getting worse</strong><br><br> The Affliction sweeping through our people is getting worse.

At runtime, these Cores establish a radio communications interlink between the Star Control mainframe and the linked robotic systems, allowing the mainframe to coordinate their actions and issue commands irrespective of their underlying operating protocols.<br><br> Individual Star Cores may be safely replaced during normal operation. In the event of a major failure, Star Control can still boot into a limited-functionality Emergency Mode if at least one Star Core is present. While the system is in Emergency Mode, all robots and defenses will continue to act on their prior operating instructions. As Cores are replaced, a series of emergency protocols will be progressively unlocked as computing resources permit, allowing the user to react to urgent problems until full functionality can be restored.<br><br> For additional sales, service, or technical support, please contact the RobCo Enterprise Solutions division.

Seemed to go pretty well. RobCo's communications interlink doesn't play nice with older-model Handys we've got working concessions-- big surprise there-- but I'm still glad we went with their bid over the one from General Atomics. Their 'Director' system is a mess-- single point of failure and all.

That never happens-- big install jobs like this are always a disaster. And we've got military-grade robots running around with live weapons. This thing seems like an accident waiting to happen. But so far, it works as advertised. Color me impressed.<br><br> Mark and I have been digging through the control code, and we've verified that the Defensive Mode protocol Admin wanted seems to be in place. If there is a major emergency of some kind, we flip the system into Defensive Mode and use the robots to secure the park. There's no real way to test it; let's just hope it never comes to that.<br><br><strong> Technician's Log - 10/22/2077</strong><br><br> The mainframe tours have been a big hit. Lucky us.

He thought, \"A day like this should be everyday!\" and the idea for Nuka-World was born.<br><br> Construction was started in July 2049, and despite everyone's doubts, opened less than a year later on May 1, 2050. Nuka-World featured Nuka-Town U.S.A. and Kiddie Kingdom as its two main attractions. Nuka-World's opening day saw tremendous success with over 40,000 tickets sold.<br><br> Due to the overwhelming success, the plans to expand Nuka-World were immediately set in motion. Dry Rock Gulch opened in 2058, followed by Safari Adventure in 2067. On both occasions, the amount of visitors almost doubled overnight. The Galactic Zone, the last and most ambitious of the planned parks, opened to the public in 2072.<br><br><strong> Kiddie Kingdom</strong><br><br> Kiddie Kingdom was the original featured park of Nuka-World. Famous for its sugary dessert theme, John-Caleb Bradberton wanted to focus on a place for younger children to enjoy.<br><br> Some of Kiddie Kingdom's more popular attractions include the Ferris Wheel, King Cola's Castle, Nuka Racers and the Fun House.<br><br> Kiddie Kingdom is located northeast of Nuka-Town U.S.A.<br><br><strong> The Bottling Plant</strong><br><br> It wasn't long after opening that John-Caleb Bradberton realized he wanted to share the joy of making Nuka-Cola with his audience. The local Bottling Plant was remodeled and updated to allow for a fun and educational experience that all ages can enjoy.<br><br> Currently, the Bottling Plant is featuring Nuka-Cola's latest product, Nuka-Cola Quantum.<br><br> The Bottling Plant is located northeast of Nuka-Town U.S.A and north of Kiddie Kingdom.<br><br><strong> Dry Rock Gulch</strong><br><br> Dry Rock Gulch was the first of Nuka-World's planned expansions. Its grand opening was held on Memorial Day weekend of May 2058 which coincided with the introduction of Nuka-Cola Wild to the public. Inspired by John-Caleb Bradberton's own love of the Wild West as a child, and as a celebration of the Nuka-Cola Wild soft drink, Dry Rock Gulch takes you back in time to the days of cowboys, horses and saloons.<br><br> Dry Rock Gulch features Mad Mulligan's Minecart Coaster and an outdoor theater where you can enjoy child friendly entertainment. Also popular is Doc Phosphate's Saloon where Dry Rock Gulch features its very own inspired Nuka-Cola product to beat the heat: Nuka-Cola Wild.<br><br> Dry Rock Gulch is located northwest of Nuka-Town U.S.A.<br><br><strong> Safari Adventure</strong><br><br> Safari Adventure was the largest undertaking by John-Caleb Bradberton. It took a grand total of 7 years to build thanks to the valuable input from a variety of zoological and environmental scientists. It finally opened its gates during the Labor Day weekend of 2067, 9 years after Dry Rock Gulch.<br><br> Popular attractions at Safari Adventure include Cappy's Treehouse, the Primate House, and the Reptile House.

She's fine, but the nurse said she had a blood alcohol level of 0.37 after only two hours into her shift.

A day after they left, our scouts started seeing these weird glowing 'lurks crawling all over the place there. We tried drawing a few of them away, but those things are way tougher than any 'lurk I've ever seen. I've tried to send a runner back to HQ for reinforcements. Until they get back, there's really not much we can do to help beyond keeping the base camp held down.<br /><br /><b>Holding down camp</b><br/><br/>Corporal Tornin, 3rd ops log<br /><br />Taking control of this outpost as ranking officer. Sergeant Lanier has decided to lead the recon team to perform a more thorough search of the Nuka-Cola Bottling Plant. One of the privates asked why she was leading the team herself, and after she knocked a couple of his teeth out, she explained that something about it just felt \"hinky\" to her. No idea what that means, but I'm not stupid enough to argue with her.<br /><br /><b>What is this place?</b><br/><br/>Sergeant Lanier, 2nd ops log.<br /><br />Now that I've seen more of it, I have to say, this Nuka-World place is pretty strange. I can't possibly imagine what practical use a place like this would be. It's almost like a series of forts, but the pre-war gates don't even seem to have doors.<br /><br />If not for the frequent radiation storms, it'd almost be the ideal place. If we can find a good toehold to start pushing the Raiders out, this could be huge.<br /><br /><b>Establishing base camp</b><br/><br/>Sergeant Lanier, 1st ops log.<br /><br />Having been sent with a moderate detachment to explore the western areas of the Commonwealth, we came upon the Nuka-World Transit Station. After putting a bullet into some guy who was obviously acting as a lure, we decided against trying to use the monorail and hoofed it over the mountains.<br /><br />Rougher terrain than we initially thought, and we've lost coms with Gunner HQ. No matter, we've run off-coms ops before and if things go south, a follow-up team will be sent our way. One of our recruits mentioned that he'd heard of some kind of trading post out here. Lot of possibilities there. We've set up base camp on Bradberton Overpass for now, and I'll be sending recon teams out soon.<br /><hr/><br /><b>Intel</b><br /><br />==================================================<br /><br /> Regional Intel Reports<br /><br />==================================================<br /><br /><b>Nuka-Town USA.</b><br/><br/>Pvt. Benson said he'd heard of some sort of trading post to the south at Nuka-World. Something called Nuka-Town U.S.A., but that intel is clearly out of date. Recon scouts have reported the location of a substantial Raider encampment. Easily one of the biggest we've ever seen in the Commonwealth. Unless we can gain a fortified location and bring in reinforcements, there is no chance of taking that place.<br /><br /><b>Bradberton</b><br/><br/>Recon team to the north has reported on the town we can see from our location. Pre-war town by the name of Bradberton. Currently unoccupied, but overrun with ghouls and other critters. Low chance of high-value salvage. Moving on for now.<br /><br /><b>Kiddie Kingdom</b><br/><br/>Initial recon of the area has reported heavy radioactive mist. Danger could be mitigated with available suits of power armor. Initial assessment: despite the potential for a easily fortified base of ops, the potential cost in troops and supplies currently outweighs the benefit. Shame, I would have liked having my own goddamn castle.<br /><br /><b>Bottling Plant</b><br/><br/>Finally gave in to the badgering of some of my troops and sent a team to investigate the Bottling Plant at Nuka-World. They seemed to think that place would literally be able to print bottle caps, but anything that valuable would have been scrapped ages ago. They snuck around and found a back entrance to the factory, and there seems to be some decent pre-war robots still active inside.

Langston, Subliminal Suggestions Tech<br><br> <strong>Daily Observation 09HJ900</strong><br><br> Tech ratcheted-up the frequency on the Subliminal Suggestion Emitters a few notches yesterday, and we're checking out the effect. Honestly, I can't see an appreciable difference. We're using the Blue Grade Holotape suggestions, simple stuff like \"take off your hat,\" \"you have an itch on your nose,\" \"blink your eyes a few times...\" stuff like that. The frequency boost was supposed to widen the spectrum and grab more people, but I'm counting the same numbers over the last six hours. I might try the Orange Grade Holotapes tomorrow.<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 09HJ907</strong><br><br> The Orange Grade Holotape suggestions really did the trick. The more apprehensive the subject is to the suggestion, the more susceptible they are to the emitted frequency. Doesn't make sense to me, but Dr. Bateman seems to think it has something to do with the subject's \"fight or flight\" tendencies. When a very low-grade suggestion is made, the fight or flight doesn't need to kick in, so no chemicals are released into the body like adrenaline. The tone we play with suggestions from the emitters causes endorphin release. Dr. Bateman thinks that releasing endorphins and adrenaline at the same time is having some sort of chemical effect that's making the subject unconsciously eager to \"have more,\" almost like a drug addiction. It's fascinating stuff.<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 09HJ910</strong><br><br> Went a little too far with the Orange Grade stuff today. I'm pretty sure the \"shove the visitor in front of you\" suggestion got through to this lady and she did exactly that. Unfortunately, the other lady she shoved wasn't so forgiving and they started a fistfight. Had to hit the alarm and security pulled them out of the exhibit. Dr. Bateman told me to just go with Blue Grade for a while until things calm down-- maybe a few days at most. To tell you truth, I'm glad to make the switch. The Orange Grade stuff kind of scares me. Come to think of it, what scares me more is that we have Red Grade Holotapes too. Never used them, and hope we never will.<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 09HJ915</strong><br><br> Been on Blue Grade for almost a week now, and frankly, it's getting boring again. I decided to throw in the Orange Grade Holotape for a little while and see what happens. Best hour of the week, for sure. Didn't have any fistfights this time, but got a guy to drink someone else's Nuka-Cola, made a lady pick a guy's pocket and keep his wallet, and actually had a guy just piss in his pants without a care in the world. This is premium stuff. I think I'll send this tape and the frequency we're using to headquarters so they can analyze it further.<br><br><h1> Experiment 004 observation terminal</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> C. Grunner, Theta Radiation Tech<br><br> Experiment 004 Observation Terminal<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 07HJ902</strong><br><br> Dr. Bateman suggested we try Theta Radiation in the Reactor Area and observe the results it had on the visitors. Unlike standard ionizing radiation, theta isn't supposed to leave any lasting physical effects and works almost instantly. It's been quite a chore keeping up with doctor's reports and aftercare sometimes months after the visitor left the park, so this will be a welcome change. I'll climb into the chamber tonight and change out the core dampener myself, just to make certain it's done to Dr. Bateman's specifications.<br><br> <strong>Daily Observation 07HJ903</strong><br><br> It appears that at low levels, the Theta Radiation is having the exact effects that Dr. Bateman predicted. People are getting tired, getting a bit dizzy, looking momentarily lost and slurring their speech on occasion. The effect seems to last for maybe five minutes at the most, which is beyond our expectations. I will continue to observe and record the effect and send all of the data to Vault-Tec Headquarters first thing in the morning.<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 07HJ907</strong><br><br> I've been observing the effect of the Theta Radiation for almost four days now, and I'm not really generating any new data points. Frankly, it's getting boring in this control center, and with Dr. Bateman breathing down my neck, I can't do anything recreational. I am literally staring at the same readouts for hours at a time. I was okay with it at first, but now it's starting to get to me. I wish Dr. Bateman would allow me to dial up the Theta Radiation, but he said we need long-term observation at a constant level. I don't get why I can't mess with the settings. Hell, even Langston who sits right behind me gets to mess around with the holotapes and try out different things. Oh well.<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 07HJ910</strong><br><br> Dr. Bateman woke me up from a nap I was having at my console and yelled at me for falling asleep on the job. I couldn't even remember falling asleep. Then it sort of hit me. I mean, what if Dr. Bateman piped the Theta Radiation in here too? I'd be a perfect long-term subject, right? I spent the better part of an hour tearing open all of the maintenance panels in the place, but I can't find out how he's doing it. If he's doing it. Just the thought of it is really starting to piss me off.<br><br><strong> Daily Observation 07HJ915</strong><br><br> I've had enough of this crap. I don't know if Langston is messing with me, or Bateman is messing with me, or both of them are, but I feel like I'm one of the visitors to the exhibit and someone else is watching me. Well, guess what? I'm locking the doors to this place and nobody's going to come in here. If I have to spend the rest of October in here all by myself, then so be it! And if Bateman tries to use the override to open the doors, I've got a sweet 10mm pistol in my hand just waiting to be fired.<br><br> <strong>Daily Observation 07HJ920</strong><br><br> I don't know if I'm paranoid, a victim of my own experimentation, or what the hell is going on. Langston ran in here today screaming something about bombs falling and to \"seal the Vault.\" He kept yelling and screaming and the sound was making my head split. I couldn't take it anymore, so I shot him... I shot him dead. I tried to leave the Control Room, but we're locked in. Or are we locked in? I don't know what's real anymore and what isn't. My head hurts all of the time, I keep getting dizzy, I keep falling asleep. Is the world gone? Was Langston lying or telling the truth? I don't know what to do. Maybe it's time I put an end to this. I think I know what I have to do.<br><br><h1> Operations terminal</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> J. Hodgson, Operations Engineer<br><br> <strong>Journal Entry 011677</strong><br><br> It's my first day on the job here at the Vault-Tec exhibit. Never thought they'd let me work in Nuka-World. I mean, you can hardly call this a job. All I have to do is make sure the exhibit doesn't fall apart, all the techs are happy and sometimes conduct a tour or two. Plus I'm getting paid double what I made at the Washington D.C. office.<br><br> One of the guys working at Nuka-Galaxy said they give rides to the employees after the park closes, so I'll probably head over there after work and check it out.<br><br><strong> Journal Entry 021977</strong><br><br> Had a scare when this old guy collapsed after walking through the exhibit. I thought he might have had a heart attack, but Dr. Bateman said that it was just heatstroke. I thought that was a weird excuse because we keep the exhibit at a constant 72 degrees. Maybe that's too hot for old folks? I'll bring it up at the next staff meeting.<br><br><strong> Journal Entry 042077</strong><br><br> Another really strange day. Dr. Bateman locked himself out of the Observation Room again. I told him to put a spare key in his locker so he wouldn't forget it next time. He brushed me off, and left the room. I don't know why, but the whole interaction made me really, really angry. A few minutes later I had a bad headache. Maybe something's wrong with the filtered air system in the exhibit?<br><br><strong> Journal Entry 042377</strong><br><br> The hell is going on around here? I don't know if someone is messing with my terminal or if I'm losing my mind. I don't remember making that last journal entry about getting angry or having a headache. I've felt perfectly fine for weeks.<br><br> Just a few minutes ago, Dr. Bateman came through, and out of nowhere, he said I should really stop drinking on the job. I do smell a little bit like whisky, but I don't remember drinking any.<br><br> Maybe I need a vacation. Or a doctor's appointment.<br><br><strong> Journal Entry 0053077</strong><br><br> All right, I've had enough of this. A lady just went nuts and ran out of the exhibit screaming. The day before that, some guy took off all his clothes for no reason and acted like he didn't have a care in the world until security dragged him away. To make matters worse, I keep getting sudden nosebleeds and headaches. I'm constantly forgetting things I've done and misplacing stuff I shouldn't be losing. Dr. Bateman said he thinks it has something to do with stress or new job anxiety, but come on. Nosebleeds and memory loss from job anxiety?

As people exit the Vault-Tec: Among the Stars exhibit, you'll be responsible for taking visitors aside and converting them to potential applicants. Even if they seem interested, remember that the applicant will have many questions but very little time on their hands. How can you ensure you're prepared to step them through our sales process in a quick and accurate manner? Simple! Remember the \"The Three I's\": Introduction, Initiation and Information.<br><br> Note: If any of the applicants appear to be ill or acting in a strange manner, be certain to report this to a sales supervisor immediately.<br><br><strong> Step One: Introduction</strong><br><br> First and foremost, greet the applicant with a hearty handshake and a warm smile. Perhaps tell a light (clean) joke to make them laugh or a pleasant compliment about their appearance. Ask them if they want something to drink or offer them a snack. Check how they're feeling and gauge their mood. Make them feel like they're already home and a part of the Vault-Tec family. Studies show beginning with this approach increases the chances of a sale by over 28%!<br><br><strong> Step Two: Initiation</strong><br><br> When you feel like you've gained their confidence, explain the benefits of life within a Vault using the information from our \"Better Living Underground\" packet. If they still appear hesitant, don't pester them or give them the \"hard sell.\" Our studies show that this over-aggressive approach usually turns the applicants off, and they become unwilling to listen to anything you have to say. For the overly-skeptical applicant, or if you need something to tip the scales if you think the applicant is undecided, we suggest letting them glance through the \"History Of Radiation Burns\" or the \"Mutations: It Could Happen To You\" brochures.<br><br><strong> Step Three: Integration</strong><br><br> So, you've finally convinced the applicant to sign? Good job! Now it's time to step them through the quick and painless application process. Pull the following forms from the New Applicants file: GZ089 Health Form, TR17 Liability Wavier, LM222 Last Will and Testament Form, DB104 Vault-Tec Citizenship Agreement, XM003 Organ Donation Invoice, HW660 Psychological Evaluation Screening, KY269 Intimate Relations Conduct Agreement, PLK575 Rights Revocation Charter and the FQS010 Family History Form. Have the applicant fill these out in quintuplicate.<br><br> File the daffodil-colored copy in the Corporate Bin, file the lemon-colored copy in the Local Bin, place the canary-colored copy in the Medical Bin, place the gold-colored copy in the Insurance Bin and present the yellow copy to the applicant.

None of us have left the lab in the past three weeks, so I'm giving the others vacation time while J.C. and I go over the data with General Braxton. The sooner he signs off on the research, the sooner we can start testing. Dr. Leavitt wasn't happy when I put the whole Beverageer team onto Project Cobalt, but if she wants to keep her job at Nuka-World, she doesn't have much of a choice.<br><br><strong> Meacham RMNC-0987115</strong><br><br> After getting the final okay on our data from General Braxton, we began the actual synthesis process. Based on our initial data, we went with a strontium-90 derivative. It was an immediate success. The weapons we applied the new, bluish payload material to was amplified well beyond our expectations. Ironically, with a slight tweak to the synthesis, we ended up with a totally stable and relatively safe additive that could give a drink a unique bluish glow. I don't know why I was thinking soft drinks at that point, I suppose there was a little bit of Beverageer left in me after all.<br><br><strong> Meacham RMNC-0987120</strong><br><br> As far as our new soft drink went, I decided to call it \"Quantum.\" To keep Dr. Leavitt from quitting the team, I put her in charge of that project while Bennell and Medford continued working on Project Cobalt. We had the boys over at the laboratory in Washington D.C. lend us a hand with the live subject testing. Isotopes CE770 and CE772 were close, but caused all sorts of problems with the test subjects. But when we hit CE774, it was that eureka moment we were waiting for. No deaths, only a few mild cases of dizziness and other benign side-effects. A new flavor was born.<br><br><strong> Meacham RMNC-0987129</strong><br><br> I was supposed to meet with Bradberton today. Unfortunately, Peyton Huxley said he was sick, but he assured me that J.C. was absolutely over the moon about the progress on the weapons program and the \"Quantum\" soft drink. He said the test pilot program in Washington D.C. had gone through the roof, and this could be the company's biggest seller in years. In fact, they decided to call it Nuka-Cola Quantum, using the name I came up with! I don't think the day could have gone any better. It's too bad J.C. wasn't around to celebrate.<br><br> <strong>Meacham RMNC-0987133</strong><br><br> Ruth is dead. I had to do it. I had no choice. She was going to compromise the entire lab.

We've been safe down here for over a year now and there's no reason we couldn't keep going for at least another six months.

It's a shame too, because she's the best organic chemist we have. I guess we'll just have to rely on Dr. Medford from now on.<br><br> Kevin: Wait. She's leaving?

Wasn't as hard as I thought. After he took me in as a kid, raised me, trained me... I would have thought I'd at least hesitate. But he was the one that \"accidentally\" had my parents killed to begin with. And then he made the fatal mistake of leaving me behind. Bastard probably thought I was as good as dead, but after all the times I stood by him, seeing that coward tuck tail and run erased any loyalty and respect I ever had for him.<br><br> The best part was the look on his face when I came back. I still don't even know how I managed to escape, but with the amount of blood I had on me, I got a feeling it wasn't pretty for my enemies. After that, I realized just how much of what he said was pure bullshit. I gave him at least a month to listen to me which feels merciful looking back. But it's done now.<br><br><strong>Entry 2</strong><br><br><br> With Sledge dead, along with any other asshole who didn't want to follow me, there's been a lot of changes around here. I've been calling ourselves the Disciples. We follow the natural way of the world: kill or be killed, survival of the fittest, that kinda stuff. In times like these, it's the only thing that makes sense. I watch these farmers, much like my own parents, struggle for some sense of civilization, only to be crushed by Super Mutants, radscorps, or, of course, Raiders. There's nothing friendly about this world, and the only way to beat it is to be better.<br><br> We've already managed to get a pretty good rep around here. Word spreads fast and apparently way further than I thought. I got some message from a guy named Gage. Says he wants to talk, make a deal. Seems interesting. I almost felt guilty cutting the messenger's throat.<br><br><strong>Entry 3</strong><br><br><br> So Gage had a proposition for us. We help him and another guy named Colter take a trading hub called Nuka-World, and make it our own so we're set for life. Drawbacks are we gotta do this with two other gangs... and holy shit, you should see these guys. Plus they expect all of us to get along, so no killing... that they can prove.<br><br> No one's going to be a fan of the \"no kill\" policy, but I think it's doable with a \"don't get caught\" clause in there. And admittedly, we're running out of bodies to drain anyway. People are wising up and moving on. If we get ourselves a major outpost and can stick to this one teeny tiny rule, I think we could have it made.<br><br><strong>Entry 4</strong><br><br><br> It's been almost a year at Nuka-World with no movement from Colter. The only bonus was building the Gauntlet. It's at least mildly entertaining and helps keep us... calm. But it's time for a change. I can tell the other leaders aren't happy. If Colter doesn't make a move soon, both him and Gage are going to find themselves at the other end of my knife.<br><br> Updated: Apparently, Mags, Mason, and I aren't the only ones getting anxious. Gage stopped by, which I gotta admit, took some balls. He's got a plan to get rid of Colter and get a new Overboss to replace him. Also known as a plan to save his own ass. Might as well throw Colter under the bus, and let him take the fall. He knows he can't promote me, Mason, or Mags without all hell breaking loose, so he better know what he's doing.<br><br><strong>Entry 5</strong><br><br><br> It's done. Gage pulled it off. Not only did he get some fresh blood in here to replace Colter, but that fresh blood took out Colter at the same time. It's too early to be impressed, though. There's no way to beat Colter without Gage's help, so whether we got a shiny, new Overboss, or another piece of shit dud remains to be seen.<br><br><br><strong>Entry 6</strong><br><br> Looks like our new Overboss is the real deal. Not only did we take all of Nuka-World, but the Operators are out. Bye bye spoiled little Magsy and her shit-for-brains brother, William. Sure, Mason is still around with his herd of sheep, but whatever. If we need to deal with them, there'd be no contest. Let's just hope this new Overboss keeps it up, and doesn't get lazy like Colter.

A small MRI specifically designed to fit in the phoropter when fed enough power and imaging can process the visual information response from stimuli. In layman's terms, it can read a test subject's mind and show an actual picture of what they're thinking about.<br><br> That's the promise, at least, but the images are very grainy and indisctinct. Starting from teh standard Rorschach test with hundreds of \"volunteers\" our computers could reliably indentify these images with 71% accuracy. It's still early days, but the promise of getting involuntary glimpses into a population's mind could be a game changer for Vault management.<br><br> We then developed far more useful word associations that could assist any Overseer. By default the following are programmed in: Traitor, Inefficiency, Gossip, Complaint, and Kitten (that was our test case - hitting bugs removing it from the line up).<br><br><strong>Phoropter Experiment</strong><br><br><br> Experimental control module: PRIMED<br> Parameter selected: VAULT MONITORING<br><br><strong> Improved Eye Care</strong><br><br> Lock in IMPROVED EYE CARE parameters?<br><br><strong>R&amp;D Lead Notes</strong><br><br><br> Simple synopsis of this experiment: Ted.<br><br> His team made a better tool for optometrists everywhere.

Casinos throughout the country have spent millions to further refine its appeal. An in depth analysis of the techniques involved in Commonwealth Psychology Today gave me the inspiration to use gambling as a positive motivational force in the vault.<br><br> The big unanswered question is what's the best way to use this device. Options:<br><br> a) The device could manipulate probability to first entice a subject then later drain them of all financial resources. This would ensure the maximum amount of revenue for the vault. This is the \"Indentured Servitude\" parameter.<br><br> b) The machine itself could be a standard game of chance. But the machine is capable of identifying behavior and allowing the Overseer to track those with degenerate behavior. \"Customer Profiling\".<br><br> c) If there's time for a control, the probability could be adjusted to maximize the returns. I.e. gamblers will win more often than not. Undoubtedly this would prove popular (and expensive). But the \"Lost Revenue\" parameter should only be chosen for A/B testing.<br><br><h1> Vault 88 Overseer's desk (self-build)</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> Clearance: Overseer's Eyes Only<br><br><strong> Prime Directive</strong><br><br> CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL<br><br> OVERSEER EYES ONLY | VIOLATION VTP-01011<br><br> Vault 88 is designed to test a variety of prototype devices with the aim of rolling them out through the rest of the Vaults. Once Vault 88 is fully operational, we expect to roll out new devices every fiscal quarter. The initial prototypes are admittedly rough, so do the best you can with them.<br><br> Unlike other Vaults, we'll send test subjects before any disaster scenario. Best estimate is early 2078 you'll have your first batch. Use each batch as long as feasible, but we are prepared to replace personnel if there are complications.<br><br> Quick iteration time is a must.<br><br> If the Vault goes on lock down, the urgency of the time table diminishes.

Curtis brought up the idea of giving us unrestricted access to the lab, but Prof. Campbell said that he needs to make sure things are established and safe first. Thus far we've had trouble in containing the plasmon scattering from the electron beam. I've checked and rechecked the professors calculations and they seem good, but it just doesn't replicate in our own practicals.<br><br><strong>Improved scattering patterns</strong><br><br><br> Progress has improved now that Curtis and I have full access to the lab. My parents think I've gotten a job at the credit union and have been pushing me to go into banking. If they knew Mr. Rivera is actually a sergeant undercover, they would flip. We've been having much better results with containing the plasmons since we decided to try focusing the electron beam down to around 200 nm. The scattering patterns are showing up with much better grouping on the Cathodeluminecense graph. At this scale it may not end up being any good for reactor containment, but we might at least be able to improve energy consumption for small industrial or weaponry uses.<br><br> I can't believe Prof. Campbell used my birthday as the password, or that Curtis had to look it up!<br><br><strong>What is going on?</strong><br><br><br> I don't know what's going on out there. Curtis and I were in early on Saturday so we could try to get through the days experiments in time to go catch a movie when we heard the sirens. Some sort of EMP knocked out the power for a few minutes and Sgt. Rivera told us to stay in the lab and not to leave till he gave us the all clear. But it's been three days and we can hear explosions going off. Prof. Campbell was supposed to be in around noon, but never showed up and our friends and parents are out there. Curtis says everything will be okay, but I can see in his eyes that he's just trying to keep it together.<br><br><strong>Continuing the research</strong><br><br><br> We've been in here a few weeks now according to the date on the terminal. An explosion took out the tunnel to the parking garage just after I make my last log entry. It's quieter, but every few hours we still hear explosions. We've decided to try to continue the research. If we are at war it might help, and if nothing else it will help us pass the time. I've been thinking that if we adjust the angle to the parabolic reflector and focus the electron beam even further it might get us what we need. Prof. Campbell had the lab stocked with plenty of food and water so we should be safe here for at least a few more weeks.<br><br><strong>Time to leave</strong><br><br><br> Small scale seemed to be the right direction. We brought the wavelength down to around 75nm and have been getting a pretty impressive capture rate. Both of the prototypes are running at a much higher capacity. We ran out of food a couple days ago, and only have a couple of cans of water left, so we have no choice but to to leave the lab. We've no idea what we'll find out there or if anyone is still alive, but we've decided to leave one of the prototypes here, in case Prof. Campbell made it out, so he'd know we finish it. Maybe itsa futile gesture, but Curtis agreed with me. He asked me to marry him. If there's anything left out there.

There were lots of police there, but nobody made them stop.<br><br> Later, a bus showed up and lots of our neighbors started getting on.

Sloan and Irma were working making repairs to the walls and saw them sneaking around by that old warehouse. We tried to scare them off, but they were still advancing on the monorail stairs. Then just when it looks like they are going to break through, the Minutemen actually showed up and drove them off! They're led by a man named Col. Hollis, and Kyle is completely awestruck. Said he is going to join them when he gets older and has been following them around like a puppy.<br><br><strong> Kyle's hurt</strong><br><br> I can't believe this. None of the reinforcements Col. Hollis promised were on their way have shown up. The Gunners have been trying to find a way to get through the wall daily now. To make matters worse, while Kyle was following the Minutemen patrols around he caught a bullet in the leg. It only nicked the bone, but he's going to have trouble walking. If we even make it through this somehow.<br><br><strong> Something's up</strong><br><br> Something's going on. We thought at first that another of the Minutemen had shown up, since it seemed like Col. Hollis recognized him. The two of them went off to talk with Mayor Jackson in private. Not ten minutes later the man left and Col. Hollis followed him to the wall shouting about what he would do to deserters. Was that guy one of the Minutemen or not?<br><br><h1> Hollis's terminal</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br><br> ==================================================<br> &lt;user \"Col.

We ended up taking a group of Gunners from behind as we came into the town. Took out about a third, but at least a dozen ran off. Mayor Jackson was practically in tears when we came up, even let us use his own house as a barracks. Gotta say, it's nice to find the Minutemen wecomed like we were back in the old days for a change.<br><br> Preston has been helping them get some better walls up, and the town mechanic has been invaluable. He even has a couple suits of Power Armor. If he can get them up and running it'd be a huge help. We don't have near enough manpower to hold the town if the Gunners return in force, but I can't tell anyone that.<br><br> I've sent out word to try to get reinforcements from any other Minutemen out there. I hope at least Col. Marbury will be willing to help.<br><br><strong> Status report</strong><br><br> We've gotten the walls in pretty good shape and filled the stairwell at the monorail platform. I've had Sturges working on getting some walkways set up across the rooftops, figure if they manage to breach the wall, we may be able to retreat up there for a counter-attack.<br><br> The Gunners attack almost daily now, but we've got food and supplies enough that we can probably wait them out. Unfortunately, my call of reinforcements has been disappointing. Not a single person has shown up.<br><br><strong> Betrayed</strong><br><br> Today has been a terrible turn of events. One of our own, a ten-year veteran named Clint, showed up at the gate. I thought at first that he had come to tell us reinforcements were on the way, but it turns out the bastard has changed sides. He's apparently leading this group of Gunners who've been laying siege.<br><br> He actually had the nerve to try to convince the mayor and me to stand down. I politely informed him that there was not a chance in Hell of that happening, and what I would do to his traitorous ass if he showed up again. If someone of his experience is leading them, we'd better be ready for anything.<br><br><h1> Gunner terminal</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br><br> ==================================================<br> &lt;user \"Lieutenant Clint\" signed in&gt;<br> ==================================================<br><br><strong> Personal Logs</strong><br> ==================================================<br> Personal Logs for User &lt;Leutenant Clint&gt;<br> ==================================================<br><br><strong>Col. Hollis</strong><br><br><br> Shame I couldn't convince Col. Hollis to see reason, but the attack plan worked all the same. Once we blew the support on the highway and took the high ground, there was nothing they could do. Garvey managed to escape with a group of the settlers, but the rest was just a bloodbath.<br><br> I had them capture Col. Hollis alive so I could prove to my new troops that I'm done with the Minutemen. Even when I put the barrel to his head he still refused to see that this is just how the world works. If you want to bring order out of the chaos, you need strength to do it. The Minutemen don't have it any more. The Gunners do. Captain Wes assures me that the troops he's given me in exchange for breaking the siege will obey the chain of command, but two of the more senior troops are proving difficult.<br><br><strong>Preston</strong><br><br><br> The detachment I sent after Garvey returned yesterday. They managed to pick off several more of the settlers before losing them in Jamaica Plains. Tessa is complaining that we let some of them get away, but she's still thinking like a raider. The Minutemen are done. Col. Hollis was the last leader they had of any worth and Preston certainly isn't going to be leading a counterattack with a bunch of wounded women and children.<br><br><strong>Tessa and Baker</strong><br><br><br> We've gotten our main camp set up on the freeway here so we can't be taken the way the Minutemen were, and I managed to get the radio tied into an old tower to establish contact with GNN.<br><br> Tessa and Baker had a long talk with Captain Wes, and while Baker has fallen into line, Tessa seems to be even more subordinate. Now that we're pretty well established, and the troops are done setting up camp, I'm going to have to find other work for them to do. If they're busy, Tessa won't have time to rile them up. Maybe if I can keep her out of camp for a while the others will follow Baker's lead and stop questioning my commands.<br><br> Captain Wes also said to check with the medic to get my blood type tattooed. Seems unnecessary, but if the gesture will convince them, it's probably worth a bit of pain.<br><br><strong> Intel</strong><br><br> ==================================================<br> Regional Intel Reports<br> ==================================================<br><br><strong>Quarry</strong><br><br><br> I sent some scouts down the highway to check for any other nearby threats, but the only thing nearby seems to be the quarry up the inlet. Looks to be a group of Raiders, but with a good sniping position on the freeway, they wouldn't dare try to start a fight with us. Baker fired off a few rockets down at them, nothing major, just to make sure they know what they're dealing with.<br><br><strong>The Factory</strong><br><br><br> I sent Tessa out with a squad to scout to the south, mostly to get her out of my hair for a while. They've reported that there's not much out there in the marsh other than an old factory. Looks to be inhabited by the greenskins. They might cause a problem eventually, but for now I don't think we need to pick a fight when we've got prisoners to deal with.<br><br><strong>Atom Cats</strong><br><br><br> Turns out there's a group living at the garage out on the peninsula. Call themselves the Atom Cats, and they seem to be a pretty tight crew. The scouts have reported that their external fortifications are fairly weak, but they have several suits of Power Armor. Normally I'd say it isn't worth our trouble, but with the troops angry about losing the prisoners, it might be the distraction they need.<br><h1> </h1><h1> Sturges's terminal</h1><br> ==================================================<br> &lt;user \"Sturges\" signed in&gt;<br> ==================================================<br><br><strong> Got a new project</strong><br><br> I was out visiting some friends of mine down at the Atom Cats garage earlier, and they hooked me up with a sweet deal on couple suits of Power Armor. They're in rough shape, but nothing I can't fix up. We had to drag that one back here, since it won't start up at the moment, even with a fresh fusion core.<br><br> I gotta find some way to thank Fenton for helping me out with that. Maybe I can pay off his tab at The Hole in the Wall. Well, maybe part of this tab anyway.<br><br><strong> Mama Murphy's vision</strong><br><br> I don't like this. Mama Murphy's been holed up in her room since that trader came through. She got a fresh stash of chems and when I went to make sure she's eating something she said she's ben having \"the Sight\" again. Said she saw the town surrounded, then overrun. Our people dead in the streets or captured. It sounds crazy, but she's been right about things before, and we were able to convince Jackson to put out a call for the Minutemen. I just hope it's not too late.<br><br><strong> The Minutemen</strong><br><br> Col. Hollis rolled in with the Minutemen yesterday, and man did they ever get here in the nick of time. Took those Gunners from behind and had 'em running for the hills. Marcy's been making a fuss about how few showed up, but the Colonel has been assured us that others will come.<br><br> In the meantime, Preston has been helping Sloan and me reinforce the walls. Shame that Power Armor is on the fritz again - sure would be a help carrying all that lumber.<br><br><strong> Baker here</strong><br><br> Sgt. Baker here. Looks like this terminal is still working. Quite the set up that grease monkey's got here. I'm impressed how well Clint's plan worked. Guess I should say Lieutenant Clint. After he blew out the support, we were able to rush up onto the highway itself. With the cover of darkness and the height advantage we had things wrapped up in under an hour. A group of them managed to slip away. Good thing the Lt. sent a detachment after them or Tessa may have broken ranks and done it herself.<br><br> Maybe if we can get these suits of Power Armor back in order it'll convince her to cool it.", "authors": "Col.

At first, I thought they were merely intimidated by his confidence and arrogance. Or perhaps even afraid of his general being. Kellogg is, after all, a killer. But as I've continued to witness their reactions, gauge their sidelong glances, I've detected something else, something I probably should have anticipated - jealousy.<br><br> Kellogg is a living memorial to a forgotten program. He is an augmented human being, a cyborg really, and the benefits he has received cannot be denied. But really, the scientists here could not care less about enhanced reflexes or greater combat efficiency. No, the cause of their envy is something more practical, more primal - his enhanced life expectancy.<br><br> Just how long will Kellogg live if he passes naturally (however unlikely that may be)? It's hard to say. He's already more than one hundred years old. Older, certainly, than any other human in the Commonwealth. His complete physiology has been altered. Perhaps he'll make it to 150. Maybe even 200.<br><br> Let the petty have their petty jealousies. Kellogg is a living testament to the ingenuity and superiority of the Institute.

I cannot afford to let emotion get in the way. I must simply observe and record.<br><br> I'm told Kellogg has gone offline. Strangely, I find myself thinking of Dr. Walker. He had such high hopes for Kellogg. Such faith in the implants, and what they could mean. I still regret eliminating that project, but I know where it would have led us. Walker was never shy about his goals, and too many others were starting to listen. In the end, I believe I was justified.

Very soon, our guest will be here. I admit that I feel both hope and trepidation when I think of how our first meeting will go.<br><br> Please make whatever preparations that you deem necessary. Consider all sensitive information to be classified for the time being. We cannot know for certain what our visitor's motivations will be, especially after coming into contact with the Railroad. We will exercise caution, but we must also extend a warm welcome. In time, once a measure of trust has been earned, we can be more forthcoming.<br><br> I need not remind you all how important this is to me personally, but I want you also to think of the opportunity for the entire Institute. We stand to gain a great deal if we make the most of that opportunity.<br><br> - Father<br><br><br><strong>Power Conservation Update</strong><br><br> I recently met with Dr. Li to review the latest power distribution metrics, and there is both good news and bad to share. I'll begin with the good.<br><br> It's clear that we have all taken to heart Doctor Li's request for a greater emphasis on power conservation. The metrics demonstrate that we have improved our efficiency across the board. I'm particularly proud to note that the Robotics division has shown the most improvement in this regard, surpassing even Advanced Systems. Well done.<br><br> Unfortunately, the efforts we have made to date are simply not enough. We must continue to find ways to conserve without adversely impacting our research and production. I know that what I'm asking is difficult, but I'm also completely confident that we will rise to the challenge.<br><br> I have some ideas that will be discussed in the next Director's meeting. Until then, I ask that you please keep the need for conservation foremost in your thoughts.<br><br> - Father<br><br><br><strong>Concerns re: Child Synth Prototype</strong><br><br> I'm concerned at the pace of our progress in correcting the problems with the child synth prototype. I cannot impress upon this division enough the need to resolve these issues quickly and completely. Time and again, we've corrected flaws only to see them return. I find myself questioning whether we're thoroughly testing these fixes before moving on to the next item.<br><br> You know that I have great faith in all of you, but time is quickly running out. I must ask that you take whatever measures are necessary to meet the project targets within the time frame.<br><br> Please make this your foremost priority.<br><br> - Father<br><br><br><strong>Missing Synth Investigation</strong><br><br> It has been brought to my attention that some of you are displeased with the methods and practices employed by the SRB division in its ongoing investigation into the missing third-generation synths. I'd like to take a moment to address this matter.<br><br> Firstly, know that I am aware of your concerns and that I intend to have a conversation with Director Ayo in order to ensure that he is also aware. Any disruption to your work must be taken seriously, especially at this critical time.<br><br> However, I must also ask for a measure of patience and cooperation from all of you. It is simply impossible to gather the information necessary to carry out this investigation without an element of distraction and inconvenience.<br><br> Remember that your cooperation is vital to bringing this investigation to a swift and successful conclusion. I'm sure that's something we all want.<br><br> - Father<br><br><strong>Synth vs. Android</strong><br><br><br> As production of our gen-3 synths continues apace, I would like to take this opportunity to formalize our categorization.<br><br> The term android has been used interchangeably with synth for as long as the Institute has existed. And though some of our older residents may actually prefer android (Dr. Zimmer being a prime example), the term synth has always been more widely used.<br><br> Today, our third generation creations are truly synthetic beings, so the designation synth seems more appropriate than ever.<br><br> From here on in, I strongly prefer all official Institute records and correspondences use the term synth or synths. Let us remember our past, and appreciate the legacy of the android. But let us live for the future, and recognize the power of the synth.<br><br> - Father<br><br><strong> View Access Logs</strong><br><br> ACCESS LOG<br><br> Access: Local.

That includes the entirety of the SRB. While we must accommodate Father's wishes in this matter, we must also remain diligent.<br><br> Refrain from discussing any sensitive information, especially the ongoing investigation involving the gen 3 synths. In an ideal world, the Railroad will have had no influence on our new guest. We do not live in an ideal world.<br><br> - Director Ayo<br><br><strong>Missing Synth Investigation</strong><br><br><br> Due to recent developments in our ongoing investigation into the missing synths, I am adjusting our policy regarding discussion of this subject with personnel outside of SRB.<br><br> In brief, details of the investigation are now classified and cannot be shared with anyone other than SRB personnel, and even then, such conversations can take place only here in the SRB facilities.<br><br> Those who are found to be in violation of this policy will face the strictest discipline.<br><br> - Director Ayo<br><br><br><strong>Infiltrator Unit: McDonough</strong><br><br> I'm starting to wonder if M7-62 (the Infiltrator unit \"McDonough\") hasn't begun to outlive its usefulness. Assuming the identity of Diamond City's mayor has provided us with invaluable intelligence over the years, but suspicions have only continued to mount. This latest incident - the publication of that newspaper article specifically calling McDonough's humanity into question - might just be the tipping point.<br><br> I've spoken with Ayo, and we both agree - if the situation does become untenable, reclamation seems unfeasible. M7-62 was specifically engineered to mimic the actual human McDonough. As such, the unit's synthetic biology is that of someone overweight and grossly out of shape. A mem wipe would kill any psychological weaknesses attributed to self-perceived old age, but that body? Lost cause.<br><br> The real irony here is that M7-62, in one of its dispatches back to the Institute, requested a future posting in the Coursers, citing loyalty and years of surface. And that request alone was evidence of enough self-awareness and independence to completely eliminate him from contention. Never mind the fact that he wouldn't even fit into the uniform.<br><br> Determination: When and if M7-62's identity is eventually compromised, the unit is effectively decommissioned in-field. No reclamation. No Institute assistance. Given its relative age and physical condition (not to mention the danger inherent in an Infiltrator unit's discovery), further lifespan estimated at two weeks maximum.<br><br> - Secord<br><br><strong>Access to SRB</strong><br><br><br> It has come to my attention that certain colleagues who are dissatisfied with our policies and procedures have, on more than one occasion, tried to circumvent our established process for registering their complaints with Father, and have tried to gain access to our secure facilities in order to complain in more direct manner.<br><br> I'm sure I need not remind you that the SRB is off-limits to all personnel not assigned to this division. Do not allow yourself to be browbeaten, cajoled, intimidated or otherwise manipulated into allowing anyone who lacks the appropriate clearance to enter the SRB.<br><br> Failure to uphold this mandate will result is severe discipline.<br><br> - Director Ayo<br><br><br><strong>Power Conservation</strong><br><br> As you're all aware, Father has asked that we monitor our power usage carefully, and try to be as efficient as possible. As a point of personal emphasis, we should strive to be efficient in everything we do, but our division has needs that are unique among the various branches of the Institute. The fact is, sometimes our operations require resources that we cannot readily disclose due to the sensitive nature of what we do.<br><br> I place my trust in your judgment. If you require additional power, or any other resources, to carry out your work, then take what you need. Consult me if you have any concerns or questions, but know that the responsibility of meeting your project deadlines falls upon your shoulders, and I won't accept limited power availability as an excuse for failing to meet those deadlines.<br><br> In short, do what you need to do, and if anyone objects to the way in which we carry out our work, I will deal with those objections myself.<br><br> - Director Ayo<br><br><strong> Inventory Management</strong><br><br> INVENTORY MANAGEMENT<br><br> USER: X3-28<br> ACTION: Deposit<br> ITEMS: 361 count bottle caps<br><br> USER: Ayo.J<br> ACTION: Requisition<br> ITEMS: 100 count fusion cells<br><br> USER: X6-88<br> ACTION: Withdraw<br> ITEMS: 1 count Rifle Armament<br><br> USER: X6-88<br> ACTION: Withdraw<br> ITEMS: 20 count fusion cells<br><br> USER: X1-02<br> ACTION: Withdraw<br> ITEMS: 1 count standard Courser armored coat<br><br> USER: Secord.A<br> ACTION: Deposit<br> ITEMS: 30 count pulse grenande armament<br><br> USER: X1-02<br> ACTION: Withdraw<br> ITEMS: 1,000 count bottle caps<br><br><strong> View Access Logs</strong><br><br> ACCESS LOG<br><br> Access: Local.

Brock has decided to split our men into two teams. I drew one of the short draws, so I ended up on the M42 \"Fat Man\" Launcher team while most of my buddies are sitting pretty upstairs with the T-51B suits. I can't even begin to describe what a ridiculous idea the M42 is - a man-portable mini-nuke thrower that a trooper in the field is supposed to deploy at close range. I've been pouring over the schematics and I have no idea how were going to get this thing to throw a warhead far enough not to kill the soldier unlucky enough to be stuck with these deathtraps.<br><br><strong> Bravo Team M42 Report 002</strong><br><br> We've stripped the warhead weight down as much as possible, but I think we're looking at this the wrong way. Instead of trying to reduce the warhead weight, we should try and amp the power on the thrower itself. I know that means adding weight to an already heavy piece of ordinance, but I don't think we have any choice. One of the guys suggested we try magnetics to push the warhead through like a rail gun, but the power pack would need to be the size of a suitcase. I'll keep picking away at this problem and see what I can turn up.<br><br><strong> Bravo Team M42 Report 003</strong><br><br> We lost two good soldiers this morning. They were on the surface testing a MIRV variant of the launcher, when one of the warheads misfired and hit the ground right where they were standing. Poor bastards didn't even have a chance. We couldn't even find any remains to send home to their folks, so Brock told us to just fill some cans with sand. I'll tell you, that guy doesn't give a crap about us, he's just worried about the brass back in Washington giving him a hard time.<br><br><strong> Bravo Team M42 Report 004</strong><br><br> I was in bed last night when I had one of those \"Eureka\" moments. I ran over to the night shift guys in the lab, swept away all of their drawings on the floor and starting sketching my idea. They must have thought I'd lost my mind. Six hours and about fourteen cups of coffee later, and I had it all mapped out. We'd use a small sub-charge as a launching catalyst to catapult the warhead from the launcher. We'd have plenty of range, and the sub-charge could be build into the warhead itself. Brock seemed to like the plan and gave us the go ahead to prototype the device. I can't wait to try it out.<br><br><strong> Bravo Team M42 Report 005</strong><br><br> It took the better part of a year, and over a hundred test firings, but the M42 is ready to shipped out into the field. I can't believe I spent over a year on this single project. I feel pretty good knowing we're delivering a well-tested weapon to our own guys fighting oversees. Now that it's over, I suppose Brock will move us on to something else, but for now I'm going to spend the rest of the month packing up these warheads to ship off base.<br><br><h1> General Brock's terminal</h1><br> Fort Strong U.S. Army Depot<br> No Unauthorized Personnel<br><br><strong> General Brock's Report - June 2075</strong><br><br> As of today, command of Fort Strong has passed to me. I am looking forward to helping the U.S. Army test some its experimental weapon systems at our facility. I've already had the men preparing the island for testing operations by tearing down the old barracks and constructing a simulated town. Since we'll be fighting the enemy on an urban front, I think the best way to test these weapons is by seeing how well they punch through civilian structures.<br><br> <strong>General Brock's Report - September 2075</strong><br><br> We've been testing the new batch of T-51B Power Armor suits that the Army Corps of Engineers just rolled off the assembly line. I'm impressed with the amount of protection they afford our soldiers, yet allow them a great deal of mobility. I've noticed that the soldiers are still having trouble jumping in these things - because of the suit's weight, they often tip over on hard landings. I've had the maintenance boys look at it and they're suggesting adding a gyroscope and shock absorbers to the lower torso. I'll pass it up the chain and see if I can get Washington to spend the extra money it'll cost for the modification.<br><br> <strong>General Brock's Report - February 2076</strong><br><br> Things are starting to heat up overseas, so Washington is pushing us to cut our project turnaround times in half. I told them that would be dangerous, but it seems like we don't have much of a choice. I've decided to split my staff into Alpha Team and Bravo Team so we can work on two projects at the same time. The manpower will be reduced, but I'm convinced that we'll still be able to maintain our new schedule. I'm going to put Alpha Team on the Power Armor and Bravo on the new M42 \"Fat Man\" Launchers.<br><br><strong> General Brock's Report - June 2076</strong><br><br> Alpha Team just shipped out the first batch of T-51B suits to the front in China. Reports are already coming in that the suits are preforming better than expected, chewing through enemy tanks and armor like they were paper. Word has it that some of the enemy troops are even surrendering when they catch sight of the Power Armor troops hauling their 5mm Miniguns. Looks like Alpha Team has earned themselves a weekend pass in Boston.<br><br> <strong>General Brock's Report - December 2076</strong><br><br> Brave Team is having a heck of a time getting the M42's not to shoot far enough away from its firing position. The problem is that the warhead is still too heavy to fire the distance required - our simulated soldiers are still soaking far too many rads and suffering blast burns. One of the technicians has suggested a radical idea of using a conventional depleting sub-charge to catapult the round rapidly out of the launcher. His calculations look sound, so I am going to let him give it a try.<br><br><strong> General Brock's Report - September 2077</strong><br><br> After a few design setbacks, and the loss of one of our testing squads, we've finally perfected the M42 Launcher's firing mechanism. Washington has been riding me to wrap this project up, but with a weapon this potent I was inclined to take my time. We've sent the launchers ahead to the supply yard in Mississippi, and we're just waiting for the go ahead to ship the warheads wherever they need to go.

Dad and I left flowers on her grave. He was telling stories about her and I kind of mentioned that I don't really remember what she looked like any more. He said it was okay, but I can hear him sobbing in his room. Ugh, I can't take this right now. I'm gonna go scavenging in the flooded area. Still haven't replaced my secondary hard disk after it blew out last week, may be I can find a new one. Sylvia also said that her network port has been acting up.<br><br><strong>Good find</strong><br><br><br> Looks like Dad has stopped crying. Hope he didn't realize I snuck back there by myself. I've gotten so good that the Lurks don't even know I'm there. I didn't manage to find a replacement port for Sylvia, but I DID manage to pull a hard disk out of a large console in one of the lecture halls. Some of the data on it even seems to be intact. I'm going to poke around before I reformat. Who knows, maybe there is something interesting on it.<br><br><strong>Score!</strong><br><br><br> Oh man this is big. I managed to get part of the data off of that hard disk and it seems to be some research about reactor efficiency. Part of it was corrupt, but I might be able to find the rest somewhere else. There was a caravan passing through so I figured I'd see what I might get if I could find the rest of it. He said to the right person, that kind of thing might be worth several hundred caps! We agreed to a 25/75 cut if he can find a buyer. Now I just need to figure out how to get the rest of the data!<br><br><strong>Today is terrible!!!</strong><br><br><br> UGH. I haven't been able to make any progress with finding the data, and the Lurks have started laying eggs again. And to make matters worse, Dad just got back from some council meeting and somehow found out I had been searching the flooded area. He locked everything up and said I'm not allowed to do any scavenging. I tried to explain about the data, and he listened, but then started acting weird and told me to go to my room and not to come down until he sorts things out. What is going on??<br><br><strong>What have I done</strong><br><br><br> Oh god, what did I do?! I've been getting mail from everyone in town saying that the Institute is coming and asking if it's my fault! Someone even accused me of being a synth! Somehow they must have found out about the reactor research. but it's not even complete. Dad said that it was probably just some scammer or a raider trying to trick us, but I don't know... What if it really IS the Institute? I need to get back in there and find that data somehow.<br><br> <strong>University Mail Relay</strong><br><br> ==================================================<br> =.............University Mail Relay..............=<br> =...........&lt;User \"JSpencer\" signed in&gt;..........=<br> ==================================================<br><br><strong>[GSpencer] - No More Scavenging!</strong><br><br><br> 2285.8.12.17:42 Sender:[GSpencer]<br> &gt;&gt; No More Scavenging<br><br> Jacqueline,<br><br> I'm serious, no more scavenging until this thing with the council blows over.

I've been calming things down around town, and I think I've got enough support that I can block anything crazy in the vote tonight.

That accident was weeks ago and you said yourself it was due to a bad fuse. Leslie said she saw the Dean skulking around following you yesterday and it was going to get harder to get work done if he is tailing you all the time. Col.

Getting the generator and lamps going in the dark was a real pain. I guess city life has made me soft, ha!

But, what are you gonna do, huh?<br><br> First year in the old cabin alone. The silence is just what I need.

It seems they've begun work on a rock quarry up the road since coming here last year. No matter, just a bump in the road. I can work through it. I'm sure Steinbeck and Hemingway didn't work in total silence. Surely I can work this into the narrative somehow, give the main character an edge. Yeah, that's the ticket.<br><br> God DAMN it! What kind of sweatshop are they running over there? They work into the late hours of the night, I can't escape their constant hammering and digging. When I get back to the city, I'm going to lodge a formal complaint. There's no way those are union hours.<br><br> I can hear it now. \"Maybe if you were a better writer, you could work through it.\" Well, Carol, this is nothing compared to your banshee wails. If I can ignore your constant nagging, I can work through this.

Your staff will be on short-term assignment to monitor basic cardiopulmonary and cognitive functions. Long-term monitoring will be handled remotely by Vault-Tec technicians.<br><br> Under no circumstance is suspension to be disrupted. This includes the administration of live-saving measures. Your staff is also considered expendable. Insubordination or attempts to evacuate prematurely are capital violations. Unused cryogenic pods are the preferred method for cadaver disposal.<br><br><strong> Cryolator</strong><br><br> I've long dreamed of making cryogenic freezing available in a portable, on-demand form. The Cryolator is my latest attempt. Thankfully, we're in no short supply of the chemicals and components I need to tinker with the prototype. It's a nice way to occupy the time as we wait for the All-Clear Signal.<br><br><strong> Operations Protocol Manual</strong><br><strong>Resident Admittance</strong><br><br> Upon Activation Notice from Vault-Tec, all personnel are required to report to the Entry Area and assist with admittance of Vault Residents. Security Personnel will maintain order and ensure that no personnel or residents attempt to evacuate the Vault.<br><br> Research staff will be responsible for resident intake and escort each to the designated cryogenic pod. Residents not accounted for in the manifest should be asked to step aside and detained forcefully by security if necessary.<br><br> Once all residents have been sealed into their preservation chambers dispose of any detainees. Vault entryway must remain sealed under any circumstances.<br><br><strong>Staff Duties</strong><br><strong>Science Staff</strong><br><br><br> Members of the research team must daily monitor the vital signs of cryogenically preserved residents. Cardiopulmonary and cognitive activity in particular must be recorded hourly.<br><br> Life-saving intervention is only permitted if greater than 80% of the resident population has perished while in cryogenic suspension, and must not interrupt suspension.<br><br> Independent research is encouraged, and left to Overseer discretion.<br><br><strong>Security Personnel</strong><br><br><br> Security patrols are to be carried out on a constant eight-hour rotation. Security priorities include:<br><br> - Monitoring for signs of intrusion<br> - Checking for atmosphere leaks<br> - Settling disputes among personnel<br> - Enforcement of regulations set forth by the Overseer<br> - Enforcement of regulations set forth by Vault-Tec<br><br><strong>Facility Services &amp; Maintenance</strong><br><br><br> Due to the nature of Vault 111, personnel will be expected to perform duties outside of their normal qualifications, such as janitorial duties and food preparation.<br><br> The exact distribution of these roles is left to Overseer discretion.<br><br><strong>All Clear &amp; Evacuation</strong><br><strong>All-Clear Message</strong><br><br><br> Following a nuclear event, Vault-Tec will monitor hazards such as radiation levels, enemy invasion, subsequent attacks, and other factors. Once conditions are deemed safe, this terminal will receive an all-clear notice.<br><br> Upon receiving the all-clear notice, Vault-Tec personnel may be evacuated at Overseer discretion. Disregard any notices from organizations or individuals not associated with Vault-Tec, including government and military. Residents are not to be disrupted or evacuated. Vault-Tec will attend to their needs remotely once Vault 111 staff has been evacuated.<br><br><strong>Mandatory Shelter Period</strong><br><br><br> Vault 111 is classified as a short-term assignment. Non-resident personnel are expected to carry out research duties and basic maintenance of the Vault while awaiting the All-Clear signal to evacuate.<br><br> In the absence of an All-Clear message from Vault-Tec, the Overseer may elect to evacuate staff after a mandatory shelter period of 180 days of containment. Under no cirumstance may Vault 111 staff evacuate during this shelter period, unless receiving the All-Clear message from Vault-Tec.<br><br><strong> Overseer's Log</strong><br><br><br><strong>Preparations</strong><br><br> The final staff orientation is complete, all but a few of the residents down in Sanctuary Hills have been enrolled, and several from Concord as well. Vault-Tec supervisors came up this week to do a technical review with me. This Vault is ready to open.<br><br> I can only imagine what wonders our residents will get to witness. The notion of leaping forward in time - I almost wish I could join them and see the promise of our future realized.<br><br><br><strong>October 23</strong><br><br> It's happened. We were lucky that most of the staff was nearby when the early warning came through. We had less notice than expected, but only Nordhagen was missing when we sealed the entrance.<br><br> Resident Admittance went smoothly. Everyone made it, even the family that waited till the last minute. I was worried there would be more suspicion, but things happened so fast for these people. They must have been too overwhelmed to question the cryogenic pods.<br><br><strong>System Malfunction</strong><br><br><br> Strange issue today with pod C3. Subject appeared to be having heart palpations. Nothing life-threatening, but unusual. We realized almost too late that the pod was malfunctioning. The cryogenic array almost started thawing her out.<br><br> We're not sure, but I suspect a hiccup in Vault-Tec's remote override systems may have sent an errant signal. We'll have to keep an eye out. I only hope their systems are reliable once we evacuate the staff.<br><br><strong>Supplies Running Low</strong><br><br><br> There's been no All-Clear Signal yet, even though we're nearing the end of the 180 day Mandatory Shelter Period. Supplies were never intended to last much more than that, and despite my best efforts, people are beginning to question what we're doing down here.<br><br> If people think we can just leave when the 180 days are up, they're insane. The radioactive exposure would still be potent enough to fry everyone if the Vault seals are breached that early. The whole point of the All-Clear was to receive additional instructions from the main office.<br><br> I don't know what to do. I can't open the Vault. I can't expect our supplies to last forever. I just have to keep everything under control until the All-Clear...<br><br><br><strong>Mutiny</strong><br><br> A faction led by the security personnel have turned on me, demanding they be allowed to leave the Vault. Idiots. I will not open the door to be irradiated to death out there.<br><br> I'm consolidating the remaining supplies, putting the staff on lockdown. We're going to have to start prioritizing who deserves what little food we have left. I've been too damn generous with the rations.<br><br> If people don't like it, well, that's fewer mouths to feed...<br><br><strong> Open Evacuation Tunnel</strong><br><br> The personnel evacuation tunnel is now open.

Babowski has cast and signed a contract with Claire Redelle for the role of... the Mistress of Mystery. I don't care how much The Tomb of Amun-Ra grossed. The Mistress of Mystery is a brunette. Not blonde, brown, and definitely NOT A RED-HEAD!<br><br> And have you heard Claire's voice? The Mistress of Mystery is confident, a match for the Shroud at his best day, not some half-starved waif that's known for her shrill screaming. Shannon Rivers has worked for us for decades. She is THE voice of the Mistress of Mystery - end of story. She's even a natural brunette.

If it's that important to you, maybe we can put Claire in a wig. But the contract is signed, so this is happening. What is it with you guys and Mrs. Rivers, anyway? Maybe 20 years ago. But now, she's got a face made for radio. Am I right? Claire's got star power and that's what we need. I talked with Petey-boy and he's agreed to a couple new scenes. We need romance. And Claire's got the goods.<br><br> If Tina can't roll with this then I can fly in one of my boys from Hollywood. He's a class act.<br><br> I got a full schedule today, dress rehearsals until 8.

Her agent was having dinner with Maxwell over at the Derby. Not good. Claire's still on board. She loves the script. She especially loves the outfit, you got the shots of that, right? Yowza. So I don't care what's going on over there - we need to sign her before we lose her to the Wisemans... or someone else.<br><br> We looked into that Hopkins contract. It's ironclad. The only way she's out is if she walks. Her partner signed over his rights to Hubris, but she still has hers. If she even thinks of going to a lawyer, you gotta work your magic, Babo. Imagine if we needed her approval?<br><br><strong> 10-15-77</strong><br><br> From: Vivian O'Dell<br> To: Aaron Babowski<br> Subject: Mistress of Mystery Casting<br><br> It has come to my attention you've hired Claire Redelle for the role of the Mistress of Mystery for the show. This is unacceptable. The Mistress of Mystery has an iconic look - she must be a brunette. The Mistress of Mystery is a strong female protagonist, not some damsel in distress. Shannon Rivers has voiced MoM for years and is beloved in the Shroud and every other radio drama she's been a part of.<br><br> I know we've had our differences, but this affects more than the Silver Shroud.

I got the photos of Claire and she's dynamite. Love the alterations on the costume, it still feels like the comic but more believable. So I'll back you there. But I'm with Vivi. MoM's a brunette. Period. And her voice needs to be strong. Claire's voice isn't. Can we have Shannon dub over Claire in post (that's the word, right?) That would be the best of both worlds.<br><br><strong> 10-20-77</strong><br><br> From: Tina Hopkins<br> To: Aaron Babowski<br> Subject: I QUIT!<br><br> Effective immediately, I quit.

I lost, or won, depending on how you look at it. After the HQ massacre, most people simply left the Railroad. Only one person survived HQ, a runner named John D. He called out for volunteers to get some of the old files. No one stepped forward.<br><br> My job is to rebuild the Railroad from scratch. I think where Agamemnon went wrong, is that HQ was known by too many people. I'm theorizing here, but once the Institute hit a safehouse and leaned on anyone the HQ would be easy to find. But how could Agamemnon know just how deadly those damned Coursers are?<br><br> Current count: 13. 0 synths.<br><br><strong>2267 Feb</strong><br><br><br> How the hell do we rebuild from here?<br><br> Got our first synth out of the Commonwealth last month. Threw one Hell of a party.<br><br> What people don't know is another runaway was recaptured by the Coursers before we even got to them.<br><br> John D has been finding tourists at a pretty good clip. But he keeps their identities to himself. Operational security he calls it. It makes me grind my teeth, but he's probably right. I think our whole organization needs to be more like a pyramid. A broad base of tourists that help out, mainly with information. Then the runners and safehouse owners in the middle. Then agents. Then HQ on top of that.<br><br><strong>2273 Mar</strong><br><br><br> A whole work crew of synths escaped together. Five synths at once. We're scrambling to keep them hidden. Coursers have been spotted looking for them. They found one of our safehouses, but no one there knew where our HQ is. John developed a dead drop system we've been using.<br><br> Some vocal elements (Toby) say we should shut down. But that's a year and a half worth of synths.<br><br><strong>Pinky (73-77)</strong><br><strong>2273 Dec</strong><br><br><br> I just found Wyatt's journal. For whoever runs this outfit in the future, I figure you should know how we messed up.<br><br> We were running the Workgroup Five out of the CW when Coursers found our HQ. Total shitstorm. Deacon (that's what he's calling himself now) had an escape route planned, and most of the survivors owe him their life. Wyatt didn't make it past the first hail of bullets.<br><br> Something everyone should know: if one safehouse goes down assume that all Hell's coming for your ass, because it probably is. Always, always, ALWAYS assume the Institute has resources beyond what we can imagine.<br><br> From now on only the heavies leave HQ. And we got to move our packages fast. This slow crap hurts more than it helps.<br><br><strong>2275 Jun</strong><br><br><br> Damn it. We got two synths, or packages as we're calling them now, out of the CW. Running the 3rd and a Raider gang caught them. Total blood bath.<br><br> P.K. almost lost his package near Danvers, too. I kicked Deacon out of HQ, got sick of the lying, face-changing son of a bitch. That month he spent as a Ghoul freaked a lot of people out.<br><br> Going to keep running hard.<br><br><strong>2276 Jan</strong><br><br><br> Lesson: move all packages outside the Commonwealth.<br><br> Lamda 8 homesteaded off Parsons. She got married to a farmer. Coursers found her and it got bloody. Lost Lamda 8. Her wife almost bit the bucket, too.<br><br> Courser spotted heading south (with company). Watts volunteered to track them.<br><br><strong>2276 Sep</strong><br><br><br> Desdemona is a real pain in the ass. Keeps harping on every little damned thing. Worse than Deacon and Carrington combined.<br><br> We lost a safehouse and went to ground. SOP. Desdemona says I'm being sloppy. I'm getting sick and tired of leading these misfits.<br><br><strong>Desdemona (77-)</strong><br><strong>2277 Dec</strong><br><br><br> After we lost Trinity, Pinky Thompson stepped down. It took some persuasion. We held a vote on who should run the Railroad. It came down to me and Carrington. Might be a problem there.<br><br> The doctor, Deacon, and I have been analyzing the many, many mistakes of Pinky. Our \"batting average\" is roughly 50/50. Only a few synths a year make it out. It's hard to keep motivated when failure is so epidemic.<br><br> We're going to hit the fundamentals: operational security. Look outs, counter-intelligence, and compartmentalization. We need to reduce the response time to find a new synth runner.<br><br><strong>2279</strong><br><br><br> 2 escapees. 1 loss. 2 reclaimed before interception.<br><br> Added a new member to core HQ. Thomas Weatherby. An Institute grenade did a number on his family farm. He's rattled but very, very smart. Hoping he can arm us with something better than pipe pistols.<br><br> Organization grown. Devised rail signs and improvements to dead drops. No Coursers spotted all year. Merry Christmas.<br><br><strong>2280</strong><br><br><br> One of our rescues, G7-81, took a strange turn. Most synths are traumatized and go through the procedure with Doc A. G7 opted out. Begged to join. Did some crazy stunts with High Rise at Ticon.<br><br> Called her into the HQ. Promoted \"Glory\" to heavy. She's well suited for the role (perhaps too much so).<br><br> Been working with Tom. Brilliant, but he's getting increasingly eccentric. Carrington says the stress is causing severe psychological problems. But he's too damned essential. God help me, I'm keeping him on.<br><br> 2 escapes. No losses. 1 reclaimed. Quiet year.<br><br> Less chrome domes in the field than the last two years. No idea why.<br><br><strong>2281</strong><br><br><br> Where to begin?<br><br> Year started like shit. Coursers came out of nowhere. They found the Farm, lookouts only gave us 30 seconds of warning. Torched what we could, casualties light.<br><br> Relocated to the Beast. Then one of the B team scouts, Tommy Whispers, made the find of the century. An old DIA facility, \"Switchboard.\" Called him up to HQ (overdue), Glory's taken him under his wing (God help him). Tom relocated to the Switchboard or Facility X as he calls it. Then he sent an urgent message.<br><br> My first meeting with P.A.M... Can't describe. She made some predictions, frighteningly accurate.<br><br> Asked for data. Started feeding it to her. Very reluctant to help the cause. But after a long talk with Glory she's on board. No one knows what Glory said to PAM. Deacon jokes that PAM has a crush on Glory. Certainly PAM acts different when she's around. But there's nothing emotional about PAM.<br><br> With PAM's prediction managed to anticipate a run-away.<br><br> Year ended badly. We had a synth infiltrator at Mercer. Deacon caught her before P.A.M. But damage done. Blew the Beast and moved to Bolthole. Only an hour to spare before the coursers came.<br><br> 2 escapees, 1 loss, 0 reclaims.<br><br><br><strong>2282</strong><br><br> Promoted Tommy to be our second heavy. Tom made him a custom pistol, the kid's frightening with it. P.A.M. has us running strange ops for data. She's not always right, but right enough to be a trap. Too tempting to rely on her predictions. One day Deacon recommended moth-balling her. Took an hour to talk him down.<br><br> 2 escapees. Not many runners this year.<br><br><strong>2283</strong><br><br><br> One word: PATRIOT.<br><br> Our second package of the year was different from the start. Didn't behave lost. Ran in a straight line to Diamond City. Old Man Stockton caught her before she caused too many waves. She wasn't supposed to be on the work detail and had a care package: a map, instructions, and a coded holotape. Tom's been useless all year trying to decode the damned thing.<br><br> Third package sent straight to Diamond City again. Set up Old Man Stockton as the gatekeeper. Then a fourth came in after a week. All with care packages. All with more codes. Someone on the inside is helping us. Code-name PATRIOT.<br><br> All told 5 escapees this year.<br><br><br><strong>2284</strong><br><br> An incredible year. Everything's coming together. Tom broke PATRIOT's code, said it was designed to be broken (whatever that means). Just two words, \"Mass Fusion.\" Sent some recon there and found nothing. Found out later why.<br><br> PAM's been trying to find the location of the Institute in earnest. Failing. Deacon's convinced the solution lies in the past, not future. Deacon already knows the big secret - we know nothing about the Railroad before Wyatt was in charge (or is Deacon Johnny D???).<br><br> Deacon's been digging into Institute sightings from years, even decades before. Or at least, that's what he says. Getting really tired of all his lies.<br><br> Coursers caught Package 7. Almost nailed Old Man Stockton, too. One of our scouts found Package 8 heading to Mass Fusion. The coded message he carried was another location, Prospect Hill.<br><br> 8 escapees this year, 1 loss, 1 reclaimed.<br><br><strong>2285</strong><br><br><br> Busy. We're in Switchboard now.

Sue and Roy were both growing up big and strong, when one day, Sue and Roy were asked to visit the Overseer.<br><br> \"What's wrong, Overseer?\" asked Sue. \"Why are you crying, Overseer?\" said Roy.<br><br> \"It's just awful!\" cried the Overseer, wiping a tear from her eye. \"Have you children ever heard of Uptopland?\"<br><br> Sue and Roy blinked, and shook their heads.<br><br> \"What's that, Overseer?\" they asked.<br><br> \"Oh, it's a terrible place,\" began the Overseer, and she told the children about Uptopland. She told them about the people living there, and how they weren't safe or strong like the children at Vault 75. Monsters attacked them and evil bandits stole their food, and it was no place for little children to grow up. No, not at all.<br><br> \"Those poor people!\" exclaimed Sue. \"Why does nobody help them?\" wondered Roy.<br><br> \"That's just it, children.\" The Overseer told them, \"They need somebody big and strong to protect them.\"<br><br> \"Who will help them?\" Sue and Roy asked.<br><br> \"One day, children, you will.\" Said the Overseer. \"That's why you must do your best at classes and training every day. So you can grow up big and strong, and go make Uptopland a happy and safe place for poor people who live there.\"<br><br> Sue and Roy smiled at that, and ran off to their lessons, eager to help.<br><br><strong> TODAY'S LESSON - K8s</strong><br><br> &lt;ERROR NO FILE FOUND&gt;<br> &lt;LESSON.PLAN.K8&gt;<br> &lt;ERROR NO FILE FOUND&gt;<br><br><strong> TODAY'S LESSON - T12's</strong><br><br> &lt;ERROR NO FILE FOUND&gt;<br> &lt;LESSON.PLAN.K12&gt;<br> &lt;ERROR NO FILE FOUND&gt;<br><br><strong> TOD4Y'S L3S?/// - Q8]]x</strong><br><br> {ERROR} No File Found or File Stored in Wrong Context VT3291<br><br><h1> Assistant's terminal</h1><h1> </h1> Vault 75<br><br> Lab Assistant Clearance Only<br> Registered Assistant AM: James S.<br> Registered Assistant PM: Rohit L.<br><br><strong> Testing Schedule</strong><br><br> 0900 - Mehren B.<br>  0915 - Ellie B.<br> 0930 - Nina K.<br> 0945 - Samuel T.<br> 1000 - Brendon C.<br> 1015 - Ricardo S.<br> 1030 - Alma L.<br> 1045 - Mitu K.<br> 1100 - Close for Maint.<br> 1130 - Robert P.<br> 1200 - Close for Lunch.

As outlined in your confidential briefing packet, Vault 75 is part of a top-secret military program. You have been selected for your professional credentials, experience, and commitment to the improvement of the human genome. It is of the utmost importance that you follow the protocols herein.<br><br> The mission of Vault 75, above all, is the refinement of human genetics. Your scientific staff will operate according to the research schedule set forth by Schlett, Braun and Lambe.<br><br> You will be working with an Overseer with a background as a military officer. Your Overseer will be responsible for training and maintaining the subject population you will be working with. It is important that you and your Overseer maintain a healthy working relationship.<br><br><strong> EXPERIMENTAL ABSTRACT</strong><br><br> Vault 75 represents an unprecedented opportunity to test our hypothesis that the human genome can be improved at a rapid rate through the combination of selective breeding, hormonal treatments, genetic modification, and an accelerated generational cycle.<br><br> The experimental objectives of Vault 75 are detailed in the handbooks which have been provided to you already. This experiment is intended to be carried out over multiple generations. As such, there may be unanticipated research opportunities that present themselves. Such diversions from provisional protocol are permitted at the discretion of the Chief Scientist.<br><br> - V.Schlett, I.Lambe, S.Braun<br><br><strong> STAFF REPLENISHMENT</strong><br><br> Because Vault 75 represents a long-term experiment in a closed environment, it will become important to replenish staff periodically. This shall be done by selective recruitment of outgoing subjects. We anticipate a certain percentage of resident population to exhibit high intellect scores, but insufficient physical capabilities to be qualified for genomic harvesting.<br><br> These subjects may be, at Overseer and Chief Scientist discretion, offered the opportunity to join staff. Those who refuse should be disposed of in the same manner as unqualified outgoing subjects.<br><br> Please note that all internally-recruited staff should be kept strictly separate from general population for at least 15 years, to prevent members of the general population recognizing former residents among the staff.<br><br> Only the most trusted and capable staff members should be admitted to the Genomics laboratory, is the responsibility of the Chief Scientist to very carefully choose these staff members and ensure they are sufficiently trained for their roles.<br><br><strong> GENETIC HARVESTING PROTOCOL</strong><br><br> Only Outgoing subjects, aged 18 years, with aggregate scoring of SUPERIOR or EXCELLENT across key physical/mental/social traits must be escorted to the Genomics laboratory. Processing should be done on an individual basis, and with great care. Remember that successful subjects will likely be capable of overpowering staff. Reiterate to the subject that a brief round of vaccinations is necessary, and avoid arousing any suspicions otherwise.<br><br> Each subject should have a file for processing which indicates which specific organic material needs to be preserved for future testing. Be sure that these directions are strictly adhered to and that specimens are stored quickly.<br><br><strong> Genomics Reports</strong><br><br> Showing Records for Most Recent Graduation.<br> Reports prepared by Chief Scientist Gibson<br> ==============<br> Days Until Next Graduation: -999.66e33<br> ==============<br><br><strong>GENOME DONORS</strong><br><br><br> Overall harvest was exceptional this year. Lots of Superior ratings in the physical categories. Many of our vital organ initiatives are paying dividends. Pain thresholds have been a mostly-solved problem for years now, and we're finally getting past issues like cardiac arrest under heavy duress. The genetic material we're gaining this year should help the next generation meet goals we thought were still a decade or more off. Some concerns about aggression levels. We've had a few cases of psychological breakdowns due to stress over the years, but incidence was much higher in this group. Going to recommend we synthesize some new tranquillizers, just to stock up. Food supply remains best delivery method for general population, but should be concerned about future w/science staff, too.<br><br><strong>RECRUITMENT</strong><br><br><br> Only needed one recruit to scientific staff this year, with Washington joining the genetics team to help me out up here. Subject's physical scores were very low, and he has consistently shown good problem solving and critical thinking.<br><br> Overseer has concerns about his attachment to some of the younger members of the population. I'm not too worried. His psychological profile shows that he's very suggestible. We'll keep him on the observation deck long enough for those he had personal relationship with to graduate out of the population. That gives us some time to acclimate him to the experimental protocols without conflict.<br><br> We just need to keep him in the dark until then.<br><br><strong>DISPOSED</strong><br><br><br> We had very low disposal overhead, thanks to the excellent harvest ratio this year. Just 74% of the overall graduating class. Incinerations will be done within the week. Good first task for Washington before we begin the real work.<br><br><strong>ARCHIVE RECORDS</strong><br><br><br> ERROR: ARCHIVE CORRUPT<br> Please refer to hard copies<br> Manuel re-entry recommended.<br><br><h1> Overseer's terminal</h1><h1> </h1> Vault 75<br> Clearance: Overseer Eyes Only<br> CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL CONFIDENTIAL<br> OVERSEER EYES ONLY | VIOLATION VTP-01011<br><br><strong> Operations Protocol Manual</strong><br><strong>Resident Admittance</strong><br><br> Personnel officers are responsible for admitting residents and obeying standard protocol for sanitization and scans. Research staff assist as needed, but otherwise remain in their wing.<br><br> Adults aged 17 and older will be isolated and disposed of by the Head of Security.<br><br> Children under the age of 17 are to be taken directly to the atrium area. As Overseer, you are responsible for introducing the children to the caretaker robots and their sleeping facilities. Research protocols will not begin until the second week of containment. It is recommended that you participate directly in routine storytimes each evening.<br><br><strong>Family Policy</strong><br><br><br> Vault 75 has been built within the township of Malden, and all families with children aged 5-15 have been offered subsidized admittance to the Vault program here. This should maximize the number of residents able to report for admittance in a crisis event.<br><br> In the event that it becomes necessary, it is preferable to allow potential subjects to remain with their families in the bulkhead area over allowing adults to accompany subjects to the atrium. These subjects will not be admitted to the general population.<br><br> Some distress is expected in the early days of internment. Please refer to Vault-Tec's Childcare consolation protocols (VTOEG sec 127.1) if guidance is needed.<br><br><strong>Staff Duties</strong><br><br><br> Personnel and Security staff have been assigned to Vault 75, and provided with standard instructions as found in your operations manual.<br><br> Research personnel are to remain in their designated wing, and isolated from making physical contact with residents except under special circumstances. New research personnel may be selected annually from the Vault population at Overseer discretion. Residents are to be informed that these persons have vacated the Vault.<br><br><strong>Overseer Directives</strong><br><br><br> I. Residents aged 18 and older must be removed from the general population annually.<br> II. Residents who have exhibited genetic promise are to be preserved for genome harvesting and reintegration.<br> III. Residents of average genetic promise but high intelligence and docility may be recruited to the Research staff at Overseer discretion,<br> IV. All other Residents to be removed must be culled.<br> V. Research staff is responsible for cultivating embryo replacements to maintain consistent resident population numbers.<br> VI. Vault 75 is to remain sealed until an all-clear order is issued by Vauit-Tec.<br><br><strong>Annual Turnover Protocol</strong><br><br><br> Beginning one year after initial containment, children over the age of 18 must be removed from the general population. This will be done annually, on a date specified by the Overseer and Chief Scientist.<br><br> It is recommended that this \"graduation\" be treated as an important tradition inside Vault 75. Appropriate ceremonies should be conceived of and performed by Overseer staff, with outgoing subjects being removed one-by-one from the main living area.<br><br> Once separated from the general; population, subjects with aggregate ratings of EXCELLENT and SUPERIOR are to be escorted to the genomics laboratory tor processing. Subjects with EXCELLENT and SUPERIOR intellect ratings (but not aggregate) will be offered positions as Overseer of Research staff, per discretion of the Overseer and Chief Scientist.<br><br> All other subjects should be disposed of as outlined in the confidential operations packet.<br><br><strong> Overseer's Log</strong><br><strong> New Researcher</strong><br><br><br> Worried about the new recruit in science. He's supposed to be on simple observation duties and closely monitored until the subjects he knows in the population have been processed. I know we've done this many, many times before, but something about this one feels wrong. Not sure I should have let myself be talked into it.<br><br><br><strong>Nursery Capacity Issues</strong><br><br> We're having a capacity problem in the nursery. We are as full as we can be in the IVFS, but introducing more residents to the population is going to be problematic. I'd prefer to wait until the next turnover. Will have to discuss with Chief scientist.<br><br><strong>Fire in Archives</strong><br><br><br> Damn it all. Some kind of wiring issue caused a fire in the archive.<br><br> We lost some hardware that I'm told will be difficult to repair, if not impossible. Science lost a lot of historical research data, though I'm told we can get some junior staff started transcribing hard copies.<br><br> Some of the locks failed once the fire got bad. Worrying, but turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Science staff nearby got in and stopped the blaze quickly. If the locks hadn't failed then myself or one of the senior scientists would have had to manually open the doors.<br><br><strong> Vault 75 Status</strong><br><br> &lt;!&gt; VAULT STATUS UNKNOWN &lt;!&gt;<br> &lt;!&gt; PLEASE ADDRESS BELOW &lt;!&gt;<br><br> GENOME PRESERVATION: ONLINE<br> RESEARCH: ERROR/NO CALLBACK ## DAYS<br> GENERATOR ARRAY: ONLINE/NOMINAL<br> RESIDENT VACANCY: 100%<br> RESEARCH VACANCY: 100%<br><br><br><br><h1> Researcher's terminal</h1><br> Vault 75<br> Research Station AE-1<br><br><strong> Test Protocol: Aerobic Aptitude</strong><br><br> Researcher Guidelines: Aerobics Station<br><br> This station exists to measure and increase aerobic ability and cardiovascular health of test subjects.<br><br> As the treadmill operator, adjust incline and speed to reach and sustain target rate in the subject.

I'm actually on the research team. We always thought some grown-ups must stay in the Vault to help the Overseer run things, even if we never saw them. I was right! Not everyone has to go to the outside world. They said I'd do more good here, and I couldn't be happier.<br><br> I wish there was some way she could know I'm still here, still able to watch her. She'll graduate in two years; maybe they'll put her on the research team, too, if her scores are high enough.<br><br><strong>Ah, To Be Young</strong><br><br><br> It's only been a few months since graduation, and already I feel so much more mature than the kids I'm monitoring every day. Rohit and James both still talk about taking over the Vault. Like they think nobody's listening. Robbie and Becka still sneak off to huff propellant. We see that, too. They'll never make it onto the research team like I did. I'm just glad I can still keep an eye on Nina. She's not doing too great on her scores, though. She was never much of an academic, like me. Her physical scores are among the best in the group, though. I'm sure she'll graduate to a good team for up top. I just hope I can see her before she goes up top.<br><br><strong>Passing Notes</strong><br><br><br> Supervisor Bissell lost some papers from his clipboard this morning. He was pretty anxious about it. He'd spent most of the morning searching for them, then pulled me aside to get me looking for them while he went to meet with the Overseer. He really doesn't want anyone to know they went missing.<br><br> Turns out they got sucked into a vent. I could hear the pages flapping in there. There's no way I can get them unless I were to go downtstairs. But I saw Rohit fish them out of the vent down there first. I'm going to tell Bissell I couldn't find them...<br><br><strong>Shooting Range Maint.</strong><br><br><br> The range is really getting run-down. I've asked the Overseer whether we can have some supplies brought in to help refurbish it, but was told we should work with what we've got. Then she reminded me it wasn't even my station. I didn't think it would be a big deal to have her ask some of the up top graduates to bring supplies, but I guess they're really busy, and there's always some risk involved with her going outside. Maybe she'll ask at next year's graduation when she takes the new graduates through the surface door?", "authors": "Chief Scientist Gibson,I.

Let's see if this saves... Yes! I can already see that this is going to increase my productivity immensely, never mind Mother's carping about \"new-fangled contraptions.\" I see that I mistyped my name on the setup screen. I'll have to check the manual for how to fix that - would get annoying to see that every time I \"log in\"!<br><br><strong> 02/12/1968</strong><br><br> Still learning how to work with this new computer. Searched the manual for an hour last night, but couldn't find out how to reset my name on the login screen. Oh well, hardly worth worrying about right now. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.<br><br> At some point, I'll need to take the time to transcribe all my old paper notes into this system so that I can easily access them. But for now, let me summarize my progress so far in understanding Father's condition so I have a baseline to refer back to here.<br><br> 1. All attempts to directly remove the Artifact have been unsuccessful so far. Father's blood pressure dropped precipitously and detectable brain waves nearly flatlined each time. The results were the same with:<br><br> * Total anaesthesia (Father unconscious)<br> * Local anasthesia (Father conscious)<br> * Several types of anti-psychotics (TO DO - fill in exact list and dosage from my notes)<br> * Varying dosages of LSD (TO DO - fill in dosages from notes)<br><br> 2. This implies that disabling the Artifact in some way will be necessary in order to remove it from Father.<br><br> 3. I've been very cautious with directly physically interacting with the Artifact since the very early days - my initial attempts to probe or tinker with it were met with similar physical symptoms in Father to my attempts to remove it. I won't attempt it again until I have a much greater understanding of the Artifact's inner workings.<br><br> 4. Active scanning of the Artifact itself has proven useless. I currently consider this a dead end.<br><br> * X-rays - so far has proven opaque to all my scans. Obviously I'm limited to the amount of radiation I can risk subjecting Father to.<br> * Radio imaging - again, the Artifact is opaque at all wavelengths.<br><br> 5. Passive scanning has been more promising. This is an area I plan to devote much more time. The Artifact radiates across the electro-magnetic spectrum, and at varying strengths and wavelengths. I have some basic telemetry already built into Father's cell, and have been collecting data for the past 2 years. So far it isn't much more than suggestive of further avenues of research, but I am quite confident that over time, and with more sophisticated sensors, I'll be able to gain genuinely useful insight into the way the Artifact is controlling Father.<br><br> * TO DO - get military contacts from Senator DeSoto - they are likely to have more advanced tech than I can get commercially. Consider making deal for samples of serum if necessary.<br><br> 6. The physical symptoms and changes that the Artifact has induced in Father are as follows:<br><br> * Extreme paranoia and psychotic tendencies - this was obvious from the first. Since no drug has proven effective in mitigating these symptoms, all evidence points to this being directly induced by the Artifact.<br> * Agelessness - as-yet-unidentified modifications to his blood chemistry has prevented any further aging since he first encountered the Artifact. In fact, he may be in better physical health than before. It seems likely that the Artifact is actively monitoring and \"correcting\" any problems it finds with its host organism.<br> * Telekinesis - the most surprising ability. I tentatively believe that this is NOT actual telekinesis but is something generated directly by mechanisms in the Artifact itself, perhaps using manipulation of gravity waves beyond our current technology.<br> * Increased physical strength - perhaps a side effect of the Artifact's monitoring and \"improving\" of its host. This caused some difficulty early on in Father's confinement (before I was fully aware of his abilities) but is now merely something to keep aware of.<br><br> 7. Father's blood chemistry shows various changes from human norms, as well as traces of currently unidentifed substances. I've proven that at least some of the symptoms described above can be communicated to another person through use of blood transfusion. So far through pure trial and error I've been able to produce a serum with several of the beneficial qualities and few side effects, but my actual understanding of what the serum is doing is so far very limited. I'll continue to pursue that as time allows but it seems unlikely to be of much use in actually freeing Father from the Artifact.<br><br> 8. X-rays of Father's brain show no physical intrusion of the Artifact - his skull remains intact, and I can see no signs that it has even penetrated his flesh. At this point, I believe that the blood chemistry changes (etc.) must be being induced by the Artifact indirectly - it is instructing Father's cells on how to manufacture these substances.<br><br> 9. My most successful intervention to date has been the development of the \"Abremalin Field\" (detailed specs in files at Parsons). Earliest crude implementation (1898) was simply a full-spectrum dampening field tuned to the same frequencies given off by the Artifact. It did interfere with the Artifact's operation, but at great cost to Father's health. At the time I had no choice - he would have been impossible to confine any other way - but refinement of the field has been a priority over the last decades. I've managed to reduce the negative physical effects on Father while more directly blocking the Artifact's telekinesis power. So far my attempts to broaden the field's interference with other aspects of the Artifact have been unsuccessful - they bring on similar physical symptoms to attempting to physically remove the Artifact. But this remains the most promising avenue of my research - if I can discover how to interrupt this communication I believe I will have the key to removing it - or at the very least in mitigating some of the other dangerous symptoms (psychosis, etc.).<br><br><strong> 07/23/1995</strong><br><br> Mother and Emogene have left for another European tour, while I take care of the latest \"generational shift\". Getting more difficult to make this work in our modern age. Luckily money still talks. I'll have to find someone reliable to leave in charge at Parsons while I'm gone - perhaps Anderson could be trusted not to meddle?<br><br><strong> 01/05/1996</strong><br><br> It's good to be back. John Cabot, long lost cousin of the Cabots has returned to claim his inheritance after the freak accident that claimed the lives of Jack and his family. As usual, I have to be careful to respond when people address me as \"John\". And this beard is going to take some getting used to. But, such are the burdens of immortality. Anderson proved loyal and uninclined to poke his nose into anything, so that's another hurdle passed. I need to try to get as much done as I can while Mother is away - I find I am much more productive than usual during these transitions.<br><br><strong> 09/05/2023</strong><br><br> I've been experimenting with some of the new transistors, and it looks possible to make a portable version of the Abremalin field generator. This would be very useful if we ever had to move Lorenzo to a different facility for any reason. A lot more work is necessary of course, and testing it on Lorenzo is out of the question - I won't risk shutting down the main field. But replicating the current field frequency pattern should at least give us something that we could try in an emergency, even if I can't be 100% certain it will work.<br><br><strong> 11/22/2058</strong><br><br> I've just hired a new fellow to help with the family's affairs - Edward Deegan, comes highly recommended. It's too easy for me to ignore the passage of time now, but I've just realized how old Daniel is getting - it will be time for him to retire in a few years, and it's past time to start grooming his replacement. This is always such a difficult process that I tend to put it off, especially as Mother can be so difficult with anyone new. If Edward proves reliable, I can start easing him into the \"family secrets\" - tricky, but necessary. So far so good - Mother has taken to him, which is an essential first step.<br><br><strong> 04/15/2075</strong><br><br> I've had Robco out again. It seems like a small thing but this login screen glitch has been driving me crazy. I assumed that it would be fixed with the upgraded terminals - you can be sure I was careful to type my name in correctly this time. But no, when it booted up the next time, there it was again.<br><br> This time they completely wiped the entire system and reinstalled from their master holotapes. Unbelievably, the typo was still there. They've promised to have some of their sharpest engineers look into the problem, but I'm not sure they were being completely serious. If I don't hear from them within a couple of weeks, I'll make a few calls.<br><br><strong> 10/28/2076</strong><br><br> Apparently the political situation has become very dangerous. I don't pay much attention to current events but Emogene's latest beau is a high muckety-muck in some government agency, and has been telling her alarming stories about how close things have gotten to a full-scale nuclear war. I wonder if we are following in the footsteps of the ancients who created the artifact - if so, who might our successors be, thousands of years from now? Will a cockroach civilization eventually rise to wonder at the artifacts we left behind?<br><br><strong> 12/01/2077</strong><br><br> It really happened. I don't think I've quite come to terms with what it means for the long run - it's been one crisis after another. We certainly aren't out of the woods yet, but the simple fact that I can write this again means we are better off than most people.<br><br> I don't have time to write down everything that's happened. Fortunately Boston was spared a direct hit. My first concern was Parsons, of course - we had to maintain power at all costs. We've always had backup generators, more than usual even for a medical facility, but these were intended for short-term outages, not as a permanent power supply. Then there was the question of security. Edward proved himself amazingly resourceful - he already had plans in place for just such an emergency - thank god he paid more attention to the news than I did. Still, there's no real planning for the end of civilization. He and I have been at Parsons for almost a month, trying to keep things from completely falling apart. Edward has been out more than he should - I'm afraid he's taken a heavy dose of radiation. But there was really no choice. I'll do what I can for him - I don't know how I could replace him now.<br><br> Emogene has stepped up amazingly - I had no idea she had it in her. The man we left in charge here proved unreliable - apparently cracked under the pressure, and tried to evict Emogene and Mother at gunpoint. He didn't reckon on Emogene (and neither did I). She took charge and somehow kept things secure here in spite of everything. I'll have to see what Edward can do about a more permanent solution for power (and security) for Cabot House, but for the moment things look much better than they might. I expect even our resources will be tested to the limit over the coming years, but in some ways I am glad of the challenge. One thing's for sure - the end of the world isn't boring.<br><br><strong> 06/20/2080</strong><br><br> I think I can finally say that things are looking up. Edward has recruited a more or less reliable security force to protect Parsons. The power situation is stabilized - Edward assures me we now have spare parts stockpiled to last at least 50 years. Moving between here and Parsons is still the biggest problem - there's no sign of any return of law and order. Just the opposite in fact. But Edward has proven skilled at dealing with the various groups of thugs that have sprung up.<br><br> Speaking of Edward - his radiation sickness has developed in a most fortunate way. For a time I thought he was surely going to die, but then his condition stabilized. He now seems actually immune to further radiation. Apparently this is not unknown in the other survivors, although Edward tells me that a strong prejudice has developed against these people. Hard to understand, as they seem uniquely qualified to survive in this new world.<br><br> One benefit of the end of civilization that I hadn't anticipated - there's no need now for us to have to \"die\" periodically. I can go back to being Jack Cabot again, for the forseeable future. No more neighbors to poke their noses into our business!<br><br><strong> 05/07/2115</strong><br><br> I've lately immersed myself in Lorenzo's work like never before. I wish now I had made more effort (when it was still possible) to try to locate the site of so-called Ubar. After my initial failed attempt to find the site, I dismissed it as both hopeless and useless - better to focus my energy on the immediate problems. But now, after going over Lorenzo's papers more thoroughly, I believe there are enough clues to the general location that a large-scale search using aircraft might have been feasible - something that wasn't possible in my first attempt, of course. Maybe I could have found some other artifacts that I could have studied more directly - even if they were for completely different purposes, it would be invaluable in understanding how the ancient technology functioned.<br><br> I've also come to realize how brilliant Lorenzo actually was. I was far too quick to dismiss his theories - ah, the arrogance of youth! I'm now convinced that his essential premise is correct - the artifact he found was not made by humans. All the evidence was there, but Lorenzo was the only one who put it all together and actually understood what it meant. A staggering thing to think of - if only he had been capable of dealing with fools a bit more diplomatically, he might have gained more general acceptance of his theories and not been driven to such secrecy in his final expeditions.<br><h1> </h1><h1>Terminal (Emogene Cabot's room)</h1><br><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> Welcome, Emogene Cabot!<br><br><strong> 02/11/1968</strong><br><br> Another unwanted gift from my loving brother. Still, it might be interesting to play around with.<br><br><strong> 02/19/1968</strong><br><br> This whole computer thing turned out to be more interesting than I thought. I've been learning a lot from various BBSes. Jack's been griping about some mistake he made in setting up his terminal, so I poked around until I found the file. It would be simple to fix it for him, but not nearly as much fun as watching him try to solve it on his own.<br><br><strong> 04/01/1968</strong><br><br> Was playing around with some new ideas, and hit upon a good gag. I wonder how long it will take Jack to figure it out?<br><br><strong> 06/10/1984</strong><br><br> Went to see Father again. I just showed up at Parsons and threatened to make a scene until Jack finally agreed to let me go down. I don't know why I keep going. Father puts on quite an act for me, but I know it's not really him. Not since he got back from his trip wearing that horrible crown. I keep hoping that somehow he'll come back - that I'll see even a glimmer of the real person again.<br><br> Maybe Jack will eventually succeed. As annoying as he can be, I can't deny that he's very smart.<br><br><strong> 05/03/1994</strong><br><br> I went off the serum for a whole month. I thought I could stick with it this time, but - when you actually feel yourself getting older by the day, and know you can fix it... It's hard to give up youth and beauty, voluntarily. I bet most people couldn't do it, if they had the choice.<br><br><strong> 04/15/2075</strong><br><br> Apparently the RobCo techs don't even know how their own systems work. I mean, it's just a simple bat file in the root directory of the database server for crying out loud. Hardly the hack of the century or anything. :)<br><br><strong> 11/09/2076</strong><br><br> Things are just going from bad to worse. The things Robert tells me... most people don't even know how bad it is. And here we sit, safe in our little Cabot family bubble of privilege. I've tried to talk to Jack about it, but he's in his own world as usual. I doubt he even knows what year it is. And Mother - don't even get me started. Her whole life is a state of denial.<br><br> I know this is insane to even think, but maybe this is for the best. You'd think I could just get a gun or some poison if I really wanted to end it for myself, but I could never be that... deliberate. How selfish must I be to think that I need the world to end as a way for me to get out of killing myself?<br><br><strong> 10/23/2077</strong><br><br> It's happening. I think a bomb must have hit somewhere near. Power is out all over, as far as we can see from here. The emergency power is still on in the house, but not for long. Edward and Jack went to try to get to Parsons - priorities, you see. Jack left Anders in charge here. He seems competent enough, but there's something about the way he's been looking since it happened that I don't like.<br><br> I'd better get back to Mother.<br><br><strong> 11/19/2077</strong><br><br> I got the power back on again. Things are very bad, but - I would never admit this to anyone, but this is the most fun I've had since I can remember. I'm not bored anymore. Maybe this is how most people feel all the time... I really can't remember how I felt, before the serum.<br><br> Oh, and Anders is dead. I killed him. No one can believe it. Two days after Jack left, he decided that Cabot House belonged to him, and Mother and I would have to leave. I can't really blame him, I mean, it was the end of the world. I'm not sure most employment agreements cover that. But he made the mistake of underestimating me. He didn't know how fast I was, or how strong. I would have just made him leave, but he decided to fight. Probably better that way. One less person out there who knows about what we have here.<br><br> We haven't heard from Jack for a week. He and Edward made it to Parsons, at least - Jack radioed when they arrived. Tried to be cheerful as usual - put on a happy face for Emogene - but who really knows if they're going to manage. At least Edward is with him. If anyone can get through this, it's Edward.<br><br><strong> 12/02/2077</strong><br><br> Jack made it back, finally. He says Edward is very sick from radiation. He left him at Parsons. I don't think he expects him to live. I'm not sure why neither of us is sick - I was out quite a lot, now that I think about it. Maybe another of the many benefits of Jack's magic serum. I'll have to thank Father the next time I see him.<br><br><strong> 08/11/2089</strong><br><br> It turns out that eventually even the apocalypse can get boring. Jack and Edward are too good at keeping us safe. It looks like the Cabot Family is immune from the end of the world, just like everything else. We just shrug it off and keep on going, just like we always have. Sometimes I'm very pleased about that - it makes me feel incredibly superior. Sometimes, it makes me really really sad. Most of the time, it's just boring as hell.<br><br><strong> 07/04/2120</strong><br><br> I've stopped even telling anyone where I'm going. The world isn't as dangerous as Jack says. There are still people out there, living their lives, like they always have. I guess more of them are willing to kill you now, but that's probably just because they CAN. I always got the feeling that plenty of people would have liked to see us dead, before - they just couldn't get away with it.<br><br><strong> 03/13/2251</strong><br><br> I don't know how Jack keeps himself busy, day after day. You'd think he would realize that it was hopeless by now, after all these years and years. Maybe he's just going through the motions, the way I am? Or maybe he's stopped trying to cure Father. I mean, what happens after? To us? I'm the only one that's ever tried to go without the serum. Maybe Jack and Mother think they could just give it up, but I think they're fooling themselves.", "authors": "Emogene Cabot,Jack Cabot,Unknown[Fallout]"}, "23989": {"title": "Sentinel site terminal entries", "text": "<h1>Terminal</h1><br> Sentinel Site Prescott - Observation Pod<br><br> Launch Status: \"IDLE\"<br><br> Blast Doors: Opened<br><br><strong> Pod Alpha - Launch Report</strong><br><br> Observation Pod A - Report<br> ----------------------------------------------------<br> Test Launch #23<br> Observing Party: Richard Elmsby<br><br> We're obviously still having issues integrating the Mark 28 Nuclear Bomb with our existing ICBMs. Most likely to do with the transitional coupler not latching correctly.

The whole damn thing is full of mash water again. The first batch always works like a charm, but if you have to pop the chassis open every couple day to replace the gaskets no one is gonna want to buy one of these things. Hm... I wonder if the cultures are retaining more heat due to the flash fermentation process? That extra heat could be what is causing the problem.<br><br><strong>Investor</strong><br><br><br> I reworked the design to move the thermal exchanger so the coils wrap around the bottling siphon and that seems to have done the trick. Not only are the gaskets not melting, but it also cools the beer as bottles it. Ice cold, every time!<br><br> One of my patrons also gave me a lead on a possible investor. Jack West, the manager over at the Hotel Rexford apparently just came into an inheritance and he could front the cash I need to get the Drinking Buddy into full production. He's agreed to my terms if I let him run the prototype at the hotel for a month to drum up additional press.<br><br><strong>Recipes</strong><br><br><br> Mr. West has run into a slight problem in that the hotel is contractually obligated to only serve Gwinnett beer, so I can't use my own recipes. Luckily I know a guy, who knows a guy who has cracked the encryption on their proprietary brewing holotapes, so we've put that code into the subroutines for now. It's risky if Gwinnett's lawyers catch wind, but hopefully it's just a stop gap until we can get into production or work something out with them.<br><br><strong>Face</strong><br><br><br> West is really starting to get on my nerve. First it's the hang up with the recipes, now he says the Drinking Buddy looks to impersonal. Impersonal! What a pompous ass!

Covenant has had a net operating loss since its inception. Its expenses are staggering - the fusion batteries alone are a princely sum.

In the Commonwealth people trip up infiltrators all the time based off their imperfect behavior and memory.<br><br> It is indisputable that the baseball question produces abnormal results. But I think at its heart this is not a psychological trigger. Instead it's a defect in memory. So if we pin all of our hopes on Q4 then it's just one wetware update later that we're back to square one.<br><br> I know you dismiss my insistence that Q3 is the key, but if we have more sophisticated monitoring of test subjects - EKG, pupil dilation, response time - then the subliminal data would speak volumes.

The first few iterations of PAM's core code have increased the effectiveness of the program dramatically, but without drastic action we're approaching a point of diminishing returns.<br><br> The team asks for double the funding for the upcoming fiscal year. With additional cutting edge databanks we can boost the processing power of PAM three-fold. Additionally, the P.A.M.

Many of you have expressed concern over the delay in equipment upgrades promised recently. Let me assure all of you that I have called the district office, and top men are looking into the shipping error. Until then, please continue work as normal with the equipment we have available. The same equipment, I'll remind some of you, that has helped to increase our test scores in order to recieve the budget increase. \"If it's not broke, don't fix it,\" as I always say.<br><br> Go Cougars!<br><br> Principal Tanner<br><br><br><strong>Memo from Principal Tanner [READ ONLY]</strong><br><br> FROM THE DESK OF PRINCIPAL RONALD TANNER<br><br> MEMO TO FACULTY AND STAFF<br><br> Hello. All teachers and staff are hereby given the rest of the week off, and should let their students go, as well. When you recieve this, please cancel all your plans, excuse your class, and leave in a quiet, orderly manner. I will be very busy in my office, adjusting my hair piece, so under no circumstances am I to be notified or bothered.<br><br> In addition, all students in Mr. Wellborn's History class will be graded on a scale of A to A- instead of the usual A to F. This change is in accordance to recent studies from the district office. And you all know how much I loooooove the district office.<br><br> I'm an idiot,<br> Principal Butt-toots<br><br> P.S. Rusty Burton for Homecoming King<br><br> FROM THE DESK OF PRINCIPAL RONALD TANNER<br><br> MEMO TO FACULTY AND STAFF<br><br> Hello. It goes without saying that I am extremely disappointed in the gullability of the faculty during last weeks events. I find it hard to believe that almost all of you did not realize that the memo was an obvious forgery. Those of you off for most of last week will unfortunately be docked pay for the days you missed. Perhaps this will remind you to be available by phone in off hours.<br><br> Also, please take a moment to change your password on your terminals, as I have been told that the default one has made the rounds amongst the students. In addition, locks are being added to most doors to increase safety measure.<br><br> Finally, Mr. Wellborn, Rusty Burton will be absent from your class for the next few weeks.

Turns out, he wants me to do some work for him. Told me to start selling Mentats around school. I said Whats in it for me, Tanner?<br><br> Longer lunch time and some stuff taken off my permanent record. How's that for a deal huh? And I mean I sell stuff already so no sweat. I just hand out these Mentats instead and its free ride the rest of the year!<br><br> Even tried a few of them. Man they make my head feel funny, but it feels like everything Mr. Ramirez is saying makes sens now, right? Weird<br><br><strong>Update</strong><br><br><br> Tanner has kept up his part of our agreement, keeping my lunch hours long as long as I distribute Mentats amongst the other students. Funny, he doesn't seem to notice that I've also been taking them. My parents have. I came home with a B+ test grade, and one that I'd earned myself! I didn't even have to copy off of Clayton.<br><br> Tanner seems pleased, though. I haven't quite put together why he would throw his hat in with me and other school miscreants for this goal, but I feel like I'm getting closer to figuring it out every day.<br><br> Rusty Burton, signing off<br><br><br><strong>Intriguing Development</strong><br><br> I think I've deduced Pricipal Tanner's plot. After announcing a rise in test scores, it all became clear to me. Tanner hopes to earn himself accomedations from Superintendent Marcello and the school board by raising standardized test scores. An ingenious plan, one the \"old Rusty\" wouldn't have pieced together. But how to turn this to my advantage, hmmm...<br><br><strong>My master plan</strong><br><br><br> As I predicted, Tanner leaves his office door unlocked when using the restroom. I was able to sneak in and make a pressing of the key in clay I requisitioned from the art department. Yesterday, using my new key, I entered his office, used his terminal, and found his stash of Mentats. I also read his logs and verified my theory; he is using raised test scores to increase school funds, and pocketing most of it. Now I have what I need!<br><br> I have arranged a meeting in the Library study room with Tanner. I'm doing most of the hard work, why shouldn't I benefit from the cash flow increase?

If you are unable to engage, report Danse's last known location to any duty officer as soon as possible so we can track its movement. This attempt by the Institute to tear the Brotherhood down from the inside has failed. Despite their treachery, we will persevere and emerge victorious. Ad victoriam, brothers and sisters.<br><br><strong> The Rise of Elder Maxson</strong><br><br><strong>Opening Notes</strong><br><br><br> These entries are my attempt at writing a timeline documenting Elder Maxson's rise within the ranks of the Brotherhood. It's my sincerest wish that these entries will one day be compiled in a classic printed book format and distributed throughout the Wasteland. Long live Elder Maxson and long live the Brotherhood!<br><br><strong>Background</strong><br><br><br> Despite the defeat of the Enclave in the Capital Wasteland, the Brotherhood of Steel was still an organization divided. The Outcasts, a splinter faction that left the safety of the Citadel, still struggled to survive in the Capital Wasteland, separated from their parent organization. And while some of the Brotherhood members within the Citadel had no desire to reunite with their \"disgraced\" brothers, many saw the advantage in bolstering their own force with warriors already trained and indoctrinated by the Brotherhood of Steel. Surely they could work out any... philosophical issues?<br><br><strong>Enter Maxson</strong><br><br><br> Enter Arthur Maxson, young squire to both Owyn and Sarah Lyons, and descendant of the very founder of the Brotherhood of Steel, Roger Maxson. When Elder Owyn Lyons died, care of young Arthur Maxson passed to Sarah Lyons, Owyn's daughter, who was then named Elder in his place. But when Sarah fell in battle shortly thereafter, things became complicated. The Brotherhood of Steel based in the Citadel found itself in need of leadership, and began appointing one ineffective Elder after another.<br><br><strong>Accomplishments</strong><br><br><br> As the years passed, and Arthur Maxson grew, so too did his accomplishments. At age 12, while on a training project, he killed two Raiders and saved the squad that was supposed to be escorting him. At age 13, he single-handedly killed a Deathclaw (and gained the large facial scar he still has to this day). But it was his victory at age 15, over the Super Mutant \"Shephard\" who was attempting to re-organize the Capital Wasteland's Super Mutants, that elevated him to hero-like status. When word of this feat reached the Elders back on the West Coast, they knew the time had come... Maxson was ready. Ready to lead and, more importantly, to reunite the fragmented Brotherhood of Steel forces on the East Coast.<br><br><strong>Our New Leader</strong><br><br><br> So it was that a year later, when he was only 16 years old, Arthur Maxson broked a peace with the Outcasts, re-integrating them into the Brotherhood of Steel, and proving he was as effective a diplomat as he was a warrior. Now re-united, the full force of the Brotherhood of Steel appointed Arthur Maxson as Elder...the youngest in Brotherhood of Steel history.<br><br><strong>Aftermath</strong><br><br><br> Elder Maxson reigns supreme in the Capital Wasteland, and his authority and influence have been spreading across the Eastern Seaboard, thanks in no small part by the mobility afforded by the Prydwen. He has the full support of the Elders back on the West Coast, who have proudly reported that they've been eradicating cults that have popped up, worshipping Maxson as though he's some kind of god. Maxson himself is almost offended by the idea of being referred to as a deity, as it goes against everything he believes in. Arthur Maxson is happy to be one thing... the perfect human specimen, and example of everything a human being can achieve. Assisted, even enhanced, by advanced technology, but still very much human.<br><br><h1> Knight-Captain Cade's terminal</h1><br><strong> Medical Files</strong><br><br><strong>Medical File DN-407P [Treated]</strong><br><br><br> Medical File DN-407P <br> Paladin Danse<br><br> Patient symptoms included inability to sleep and a \"dull throbbing pain in head.\" All standard tests are negative.

I'm having Teagan give Paladin Hudson an ample supply of ammunition, and making sure Ingram certifies that his Power Armor is in peak condition. I'm also allowing Paladin Hudson full use of one of our vertibird gunships, so I'll have one prepped immediately.<br><br> Once everything is ready, I'll meet you and Paladin Hudson on the Flight Deck so we can give him a proper send-off. I can't stress to you enough how dangerous this mission will be, so it's imperative that we provide the Paladin with all the support we can muster.<br><br> <strong>Kells KS-390LC - Recon Squad Artemis</strong><br><br> Fr: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> As requested, I'm providing you with all of the current information we have on Recon Squad Artemis.<br><br> According to our records, we sent them into the Commonwealth approximately three years ago to perform a standard survey beginning with the Malden area. We received a few reports from the team and then abruptly lost contact. Nothing in their communications indicated anything unusual, so we assume they've either lost the ability to radio us or have been killed. The squad consisted of seven soldiers under the command of Paladin Brandis, so they certainly had plenty of firepower and the experience required to survive a deep recon mission.<br><br> I have several recon teams searching for Artemis's whereabouts, but so far, they've been unsuccessful.<br><br><strong> Ingram IG-444PR - Prydwen Concerns</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> As you know, in order to get the Prydwen rapidly to the Commonwealth, I had my engineering team pull her older power plant and replace it with an updated fusion plant we pulled from that aircraft carrier wreckage. I was able to squeeze almost one hundred percent efficiency from the new reactor, but the system is burning through our coolant supply faster than expected.<br><br> As we've been docked over the airport, I've been able to deactivate the main engines to cool down the reactor, but we're still eating up coolant when we're in hover mode. We're eventually going to hit a point where we'll run out of coolant. If that happens, we'll need to put the Prydwen on the ground. I desperately need your help if you want to prevent that from happening. I'll be certain to provide you with the details at our next briefing.<br><br><strong> Cade CD-440KC - Proctor Ingram</strong><br><br> Fr: Knight-Captain Cade CD-440KC<br> To: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC, Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> As requested, I've sent over my evaluation of Proctor Ingram's capabilities in the field. In my professional opinion, Ingram is fully capable of handling field operations and would benefit any team fortunate enough to have her with them. Before the Prydwen left the Capital Wasteland, I spent six months helping her design the Power Armor frame she's using to enhance her mobility. She's trained in the armor rigorously and is fully qualified... actually, MORE than qualified to be placed with our ground troops. I've been treating wounded soldiers for almost two decades, and I've yet to see anyone that can match Ingram's level of commitment and determination. Confining her to the ship would be a waste of resources and a damn shame.<br><br><strong> Teagan TG-477PR - Armored Jacket</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Teagan TG-477PR<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> You'll be pleased to know that work on the armored reinforcement plating for your jacket is complete and I'll be more than happy to send up a scribe to retrieve it when you're ready. The plating is fairly strong but I think you'll appreciate how lightweight the entire jacket will feel once the modification is made. I've stress tested the plating and it should help you resist different types of energy weapon fire as well as most ballistic threats. After you try it on, let me know if it's comfortable to wear long-term or if I need to make any adjustments to the design.<br><br><strong> Kells KS-390LC - Fort Strong</strong><br><br> Fr: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> According to Proctor Quinlan, we have a serious security threat on our hands. There's a sizable stockpile of Fat Man shells being kept nearby at the remains of Fort Strong. More disturbingly, the facility is currently held by a Super Mutant contingent of unknown size.<br><br> I'm certain I don't have to remind you that the Super Mutants are smart enough to utilize the weapons, and that the Prydwen is well within a Fat Man launcher's range. I urge you to send someone down there immediately to deal with this threat before we end up as targets for their nuclear arsenal.<br><br> <strong>Kells KS-390LC - Fort Strong Update</strong><br><br> Fr: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> I wanted to inform you that I'm having all of the Fat Man shells recovered from Fort Strong moved from the armory ruins to the lower cargo area of the Prydwen. This will ensure that the weapons remain protected as we prepare for our assault on the Institute.<br><br><strong> Ingram IG-444PR - Institute Data</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> I'm pleased to report that our new recruit has returned from the Institute with a holotape full of sensitive data. I've given the tape to Proctor Quinlan so his team can begin decrypting the information immediately. As soon as we have any concrete information, I'll be sure to let you know.<br><br><strong> Ingram IG-444PR - Liberty Prime</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> Now that the gantry is complete, construction on Liberty Prime can begin. I've pulled almost my entire engineering team onto the project as well as some of Quinlan's scribes to assist with the complex calculations needed to get him on his feet. If our new recruit is successful, we'll have the rest of the parts we need to complete the project and you can march Prime right up to the Institute's front door.<br><br><strong> Ingram IG-444PR - Liberty Prime Update</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> I'm happy to report that Liberty Prime has been completed, and initial diagnostics of his operational capabilities are quite promising. Prime is currently running off of the Prydwen's engines, and we hope to have a solution for starting up his reactor core quite soon. Once the reactor core has been started, we'll be able to release him from the gantry and send him on his way.<br><br><strong> Ingram IG-444PR - Liberty Prime Ready</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> With Liberty Prime's construction fully completed, and the Beryllium Agitator in hand, we're ready to proceed to the final phase of our operation. All that remains is throwing the switch to restart his reactor core, and he'll finally be running under his own power. I've pre-programmed a complex set of instructions into his databank that should take him directly to the ruins of the C.I.T. building. I suggest you provide some sort of an escort for Prime, because I'm certain the Institute will do everything in its power to prevent him from reaching his target.<br><br><strong> Kells KS-390LC - Paladin Danse</strong><br><br> Fr: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> Sir, I've placed our entire division on alert as you've requested. I'm instructing our soldiers to shoot Danse on sight rather than trying to capture or contain him for study. I feel that it's important we use his execution to set an example not only to our own brothers and sisters, but to the Institute as well.<br><br> While I'm aware that certain members of the Brotherhood were quite close to Danse, I'm certain you'll agree that we can't afford to allow him to remain \"alive.\" In his time with the Brotherhood of Steel, he's amassed quite a bit of intelligence on our operations and we have to stop him before the Institute throws the switch to bring him home.<br><br><strong> Kells KS-390LC - Railroad Destroyed</strong><br><br> Fr: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br> To: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> I'm pleased to report that the Railroad will no longer hinder our operations in the Commonwealth. According to the report I've just received, all of their leaders have been executed and their headquarters is now in our hands. I've posted a small detachment of troops there in case any of them attempt to regroup there or recover supplies that they may have left behind. With this threat removed, we can now proceed to the final phase of our mission in the Commonwealth.<br><br><h1> Captain Kells' terminal</h1><br> Prydwen Internal Network<br> Mail Terminal Kells KS-390LC<br><br><strong> Maxon MX-001E CP-05</strong><br><br> Fr: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br> To: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br><br> Captain, I need you to prepare the Prydwen for departure. Archivist Knox has completed the analysis of the energy readings we received from Paladin Danse's recon team and has concluded that they're being produced by the Institute. Knox is certain that the energy readings could only be produced by artificial means and only with an extremely advanced level of technology. Judging from the frequency of the readings, we both agree that some type of device or weapon is being deployed by the Institute which means we need to head to the Commonwealth as soon as possible. I'm not certain what type of ploy the Institute is attempting to unleash upon the world, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by idly and let it happen.<br><br><strong> Ingram IG-444PR CP-17</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br> To: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br><br> All stations are reporting green and all personnel are aboard the Prydwen. I've gone over her from the bow to stern and she's ready to depart. With all due respect, it would be helpful if you could let me know exactly where we're headed. It's difficult preparing this vessel properly not knowing what type of environment we're flying her through. I am well aware that we're pointed north, but just how far are we going, and what can we expect when we get there, Captain?<br><br><strong> Cade CD-448KC CP-25</strong><br><br> Fr: Knight-Captain Cade CD-440KC<br> To: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC, Elder Maxson MX-001E<br><br> As requested, I've sent over my evaluation of Proctor Ingram's capabilities in the field. In my professional opinion, Ingram is fully capable of handling field operations and would benefit any team fortunate enough to have her with them.<br><br> Before the Prydwen left the Capital Wasteland, I spent six months helping her design the Power Armor frame she's using to enhance her mobility.

I'm going to need a standard sweep and retrieve team and one of our vertibirds in order to make that happen. There are several caravans that roam the Commonwealth, and we'll use the vertibirds to track them. If any of the caravans gets jumped, we can swoop in and lend a hand to let them know that we're the friendly eye in the sky.<br><br> Since you can't normally buy that kind of protection from mercenaries, we'll be certain to get the best prices and values for trades. I've used the same tactic in the Capital Wasteland and it worked wonders. Out here, with the threat of the Institute looming over their heads, we'll have these merchants eating out of our hands.<br><br><strong> Quinlan QN-448PR CP-58</strong><br><br> Fr: Proctor Quinlan QN-448PR<br> To: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br><br> After examining technical documentation brought in by one of our patrols, I've identified Fort Strong as a priority target. The location was an experimental weapons testing facility and according to their manifests, it should still contain a sizable stockpile of Fat Man shells. According to the patrol, the fort is inhabited by Super Mutants so we're in serious jeopardy of losing the stockpile if something isn't done immediately.<br><br> <strong>Maxon MX-001E CP-92</strong><br><br> Fr: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br> To: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br><br> Captain, I've received credible information that we have a traitor among us. It brings me no pleasure to inform you that Paladin Danse is an Institute synth. I've had Proctor Quinlan verify the data numerous times, so I can assure you that it's accurate.<br><br> We need to handle this situation carefully, Kells. Paladin Danse was well-liked and this news is certain to create a panic. We do not want this incident to touch off a series of false reports and assumptions that other synths have infiltrated our ranks. The ensuing paranoia could result in a catastrophic breakdown of order and our eventual defeat at the hands of the Institute.<br><br> Placing an operative among us was a brilliant move on the Institute's part, and we can't afford to underestimate them in the future. When you're ready, I want you to inform the crew and then take the necessary steps to hunt Danse down.<br><br><h1> Proctor Ingram's terminal</h1><br> Prydwen Internal Network<br> Armor Bay Terminal Ingram IG-444PR<br><br><strong> Work Orders</strong><br><br><br><strong>Item 000345IM</strong><br><br> Type: Repair<br> Status: Completed<br> Completed By: Ingram IG-444PR<br> Item: TVR-07 Internal Air Conditioning Unit<br><br> Air conditioning unit had burned out its condensing coil from overuse. Need to remind the soldiers that they can't constantly run the damn thing 24 hours a day. Copper condensing coils are tough to replace, so had to make due with homemade version. Unit should last a while longer with moderate use.<br><br><strong>Item 000357RB</strong><br><br><br> Type: Repair<br> Status: Completed<br> Completed By: Ingram IG-444PR<br> Item: Mr. Handy Cultivation Unit<br><br> Got called down to lab area and their Mister Handy was trying to cut through everything in sight. Was almost ready to get some soldiers to shoot the thing before it hurt someone, but it tried to cut through the bulkhead and burned up its motor. Pulled the logic unit and it looks like an old factory defect on the cultivation models. I've blown out the firmware and rewrote the instruction set to fix the issue. Replaced the motor and put the unit back into service.<br><br><br><strong>Item 000366IM</strong> <br><br><br> Type: Install<br> Status: Completed<br> Completed By: Ingram IG-444PR<br> Item: Ventilation Filter System<br><br> Installed a ventilation system over the rear laboratory space to help Neriah vent the stench of her mole rats to the exterior of the ship. Had to cut a few holes in the inner and outer plating, but triple-welded everything to make sure it all stays tacked down. System is on a timer, so it shouldn't draw too much power from the ship's reserves. Was happy to help since I could smell her rats all the way down here.<br><br><strong>Item 000377EM</strong><br><br><br> Type: Repair<br> Status: Completed<br> Completed By: Ingram IG-444PR<br> Item: Vertibird Gunship \"Vorpal\"<br><br> Vorpal threw a rotor on its last landing, so I hitched a ride with Spatha and headed out to the crash site. Pilot did a hell of a job bringing his bird down in one piece. All I had to do was recover the rotor and set it back in place. There's some minor plating damage on the starboard thruster, but I'll hammer it down when Vorpal gets back to the airport. Was nice to get away from the Prydwen for once. Hopefully I can convince Kells to let me head out with some future patrols.<br><br><strong>Item 000380IM</strong><br><br><br> Type: Repair<br> Status: Completed<br> Completed By: Bainbridge BB-426ES<br> Item: Sewage Lines<br><br> I don't know what the heck the mess hall is serving, but the sewage lines were completely clogged. It was so disgusting, I had to borrow one of my buddy's Power Armor helmets to keep the smell from making me puke. I think I'd rather scrape rust of the exterior hull plating next time.<br><br><strong>Item 000410EM</strong><br><br><br> Type: Install<br> Status: Completed<br> Completed By: Ingram IG-444PR<br> Item: Ground-Level Gantry<br><br> Finally got the gantry done. I hope that I've engineered it to properly handle Liberty Prime's weight. I've also run a bunch of power shunts from the Prydwen's engines right down to a bunch of transformers under the control platform. I'll wire all of it into the system so we can change over from the ship's power to the big guy's internal power at the flick of a switch. Now all we need is a miracle to get Liberty Prime back on his feet.<br><br><strong> Prydwen Internal Mail</strong><br><br><strong>Maxon MX-001E MT-02</strong><br><br><br> Fr: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br> To: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br><br> After having a long discussion with both Lancer-Captain Kells and Knight-Captain Cade, I've decided to deny your request for field service. While I understand that you've modified your Power Armor frame to accommodate your injury, and Cade has personally given it his seal of approval, I don't feel it's worth risking your life. You of all people should appreciate that machines can break down. In your particular case, if your frame fails while you're in the field, it could place you and anyone with you in extreme danger.<br><br> Please don't take this personally, Ingram. I can't afford to lose you. My decision is final. I'm sorry.<br><br><strong>Cade CD-448KC MT-04</strong><br><br><br> Fr: Knight-Captain Cade CD-440KC<br> To: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br><br> I'm guessing you've already read that Maxson is denying your field work request. I did everything I could to talk him out of it, but he just wasn't convinced. If there's anything you need, even if you just want to talk about it, my door's always open.<br><br> I hate to bring this up now, but you really need to head down here and let me tweak your leg hydraulics. Last time you were here, you complained that the shock absorbers weren't doing their job dampening your impacts from walking. Well, I was able to tweak some numbers and I'd like to look them over with you. After all, you're the expert when it comes to mechanical engineering.<br><br> So there, now you have two excuses to visit me in the sickbay. I hope to see you in here soon.<br><br><strong>Teagan TG-477PR MT-07</strong><br><br><br> Fr: Proctor Teagan TG-477PR<br> To: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br><br> I've got a little surprise for you. Remember how you told me about those sweets you loved so much? You know, the ones that look like little colored disks? Well, Quinlan's last sweep and retrieve patrol just came in, and they found a whole roll of them. If that doesn't put a smile on your face, I don't know what will. Now how about heading over to my quarters this evening and we can split it together. Don't worry, I'll be a complete gentleman. I just hate seeing you storm all over the repair bay with that damn scowl on your face, and I think this will cheer you up.<br><br><strong>Maxon MX-001E MT-33</strong><br><br><br> Fr: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br> To: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br><br> Now that Captain Kells has transferred all of your materials down to the surface, and the gantry construction has started, I think it's time we had a talk about the timeline of your new project. I'd like you to head up to the Command Deck as soon as possible so we can discuss the details. We have far too many resources tied up in this operation to allow anything to slip through the cracks. We have a war to win, Proctor. And I strongly believe that this ambitious project of yours will be our rallying cry.<br><br><strong>Maxon MX-001E MT-40</strong><br><br><br> Fr: Elder Maxson MX-001E<br> To: Proctor Ingram IG-444PR<br><br> I was just informed that you disobeyed a direct order by leaving the airport and traveling with one of our strike teams to Mass Fusion. While I appreciate your devotion to the cause, I'm dismayed that you chose to ignore our earlier communications regarding your role in field operations.<br><br> On the other hand, I've read your after-report and I'm pleased that the Beryllium Agitator is in our hands. It's obvious that retrieving the device would have been quite difficult without your participation, so I'm willing to overlook this breach of protocol. But don't assume that my leniency in this matter indicates that my orders are subject to debate. In the future, I expect you to be more cognizant of your actions or there WILL be consequences.<br><br><strong>Kells KS-390LC MT-50</strong><br><br><br> Fr: Lancer-Captain Kells KS-390LC<br> To: Entire Crew<br><br> This is a priority alert.

When we arrive, Quinlan says he'll be sending out several patrols with the express purpose of collecting viable field specimens. My job is to oversee the dissection and study of anything the patrols bring aboard. I've always agreed with the notion that the quickest way to learn your enemy's weakness is by examining them from the inside out. I hope I don't have to wait too terribly long to put that notion to the test.<br><br><strong>Entry 0769-CM22</strong><br><br><br> Quinlan's collection teams have already brought Super Mutant and synth specimens aboard. I've collected a fair bit of data from their remains, but have yet to discover anything that will give our soldiers an advantage in the field. As far as the Super Mutant specimens go, they're quite different from the strains present in the Capital Wasteland, so most of our anatomical records require updates, which takes time.<br><br> And the synths specimens, they're a complete mystery. The models we've recovered are almost entirely mechanized, so I've been coordinating with Proctor Ingram since she's our resident robotics expert. I suppose it's only a matter of time before I have some answers. In the meantime, I'm going to begin working on a special project of my own design.<br><br><strong>Entry 0777-DK45</strong><br><br><br> I've brought several mole rat specimens aboard for my special project. I'm convinced that the key to unlocking improved radiation resistance is in tenacious little creatures like these. If they've learned to adapt to the radiation blanketing the Commonwealth, with a little help, we can too.<br><br> I know most of the crew thinks I'm crazy, but I'm certain that I'm on the right track. I just need as many viable blood samples as possible to make my theory a reality, which is difficult right now since Maxson has most of our teams sweeping for technology. I'll see what I can do with my mole rat specimens, but I am not sure it will be enough.<br><br><strong>Entry 0782-BR19</strong><br><br><br> I've run into a stroke of luck today. One of the new recruits has agreed to do a little field research for me and bring back as many viable blood samples as they could find. I was even more fortunate that they possessed a Pip-Boy I could modify to extract the blood from whatever creatures they killed during their missions. Now all I have to do is wait until our new recruit returns and my special project can continue in earnest.<br><br><strong>Entry 0795-GW36</strong><br><br><br> Success! After analyzing the viable blood samples brought back by our new recruit, I've discovered the key to creating an improved radiation chem. In honor of my resourceful laboratory field assistant, I've decided to name it the X111 Compound. I'll begin distributing it to all of our patrol teams as soon as possible.

I have no idea what you want them for - those things bite and they crap all over the place. It was a pain in the ass to collect them alive, so you better have that case of whiskey you promised ready for the return flight after the pilot drops them off. As far as getting a brahmin up there, you can forget it.

While I can appreciate their value as biological specimens, I'm sure you understand that these creatures are filthy and emit an unpleasant odor in enclosed spaces such as our hull. I'll permit you to keep them if you can assure me that you'll have Proctor Ingram devise some type of ventilation system to help mitigate the smell. Try to remember that you're sharing a space where people have to eat and sleep, scribe.

They seem fairly corrupted by radiation, but some of them have promising properties, so we'll continue to study them. Our ultimate goal is to cultivate enough hybrids to increase our heterotic yield. If we can do that, we may be able to cultivate the new species and create viable alternatives to our dependency on man-made resources.<br><br><strong>Experiment NRT-0001 Log A015</strong><br><br><br> Had a bit of an unexpected find today. One of our field scribes brought a small root he found at the mouth of a river. Normally I wouldn't hold high hopes for such a small specimen, but the root is displaying chemical properties I've never seen before. I'm not sure anything will come of it, but it's certainly worth experimenting on.<br><br><strong>Experiment NRT-0001 Log A017</strong><br><br><br> My new experimental root is doing surprisingly well. I've managed to graft pieces of it onto some hardier stock, and we've yielded a strong, leafy plant with thick roots. While I am uncertain of future applications for my new hybrid, I did a chemical test and it seems safe to ingest. On a whim, I boiled the plant in some water and discovered that it makes an oddly good tea.<br><br><strong>Experiment NRT-0001 Log A022</strong><br><br><br> When I entered the botany area this morning, I couldn't believe my eyes. My experimental root has started glowing! After running a battery of tests, I am 100% certain this isn't radiation, but some sort of bioluminescence. I intend to continue my tests to see what else we can get out of this little wonder.

This program, as you know, represents a critical research opportunity. The work we do together will lead to a better future for humanity- not only in these times of uncertainty, but far into the future, whatever it holds.<br><br> Your background in academic and applied medical research will make you a capable leader to Vault 81 science staff, and your administrative background gives you the unique ability to lead and manage the general population as well.<br><br> Thank you again for reconsidering this offer of employment, and good luck.<br><br> Vault-Tec Human Resources<br><br><strong> Prime Directive</strong><br><br> The mission of Vault 81 is to research infectious disease s and antibodies, with particular attention paid to potential mutations in a climate of heavy radiation.<br><br> Clinical trials are a vital part of Vault 81's mission. Trials will be performed in three stages. Stage I trials are to be conducted in petri dish cultures. Stage II trials are to be performed on a colony of heterocephalus glaber specimens, furnished by Vault-Tec. Stage III trials may be performed on the residential population of Vault 81.<br><br> Scientific staff will be restricted to the hermetically-sealed research area. This measure reduces the chance of cross-contamination between residential and scientific staff populations. The Overseer will have communication capabilities, but no other members of the residential population are to be made aware of the prime directive.<br><br><strong> Admission Protocol</strong><br><br> As outlined in the Vault-Tec Operations Handbook, all staff members of Vault 81 will be required to participate in mandatory drills, held on-site at the discretion of the Overseer and Vault-Tec Administration. Admission drills are a requirement on all Beta Alert days, as indicated by the Vault-Tec early warning system.<br><br> In the event of an actual Alpha Alert, Vault 81 residents will be admitted into the Vault by Overseer's staff. All scientific staff should report to their workstations immediately, avoiding contact with the general population, especially those whom they may know personally. (If necessary, Overseer should remind staff of their confidentiality status.)<br><br> All residents should be admitted in an orderly fashion, and given the approved welcome address in the common area atrium by the Overseer. The Overseer should then use this terminal to confer privately with the head of Science staff, by now safely sealed in the research area.<br><br> <strong>Evacuation Protocol</strong><br><br> Vault 81 is not to be evacuated under any circumstances except a direct all-clear command from Vault-Tec central HQ.<br><br> Research reports should be archived on the primary mainframe. Chemical compounds and other physical materials may be deposited in the marked receptacle, only by the Overseer, and only after a successful Stage III trial phase.<br><br> In the event of a Vault-Tec ordered evacuation, Overseer must be prepared to dispose of residential population by incineration (propellant nozzles are pre-installed in all residential living quarters) to avoid contamination with outside population. This disposal is at the discretion of the Overseer unless specifically mandated as part of the Vault-Tec evacuation order.<br><br><strong> Overseer's Private Logs</strong><br><br><br><strong>A Job's a Job?</strong><br><br> I can't believe it. Vault-Tec must really been desperate for an Overseer candidate after Duncan fell ill. I'm certainly qualified for this job, but with my politics, how could they think I'm a good candidate for this kind of program?<br><br> Maybe there's more to this than I'm seeing. They still haven't given me a full briefing on the work we'll be doing here, but I'm not stupid. I'm pretty sure it's going to involve human trials.<br><br> I won't jump to any conclusions, though. Let's see how this plays out. If they're crossing any ethical lines with me they'll be in a Congressional hearing before they know what's hit them.<br><br><strong>Drills, Drills, Drills</strong><br><br><br> These researchers are willing to put up with a lot. Today is our fifth drill of the week, and this time I had to make the calls in the middle of the night. Half of these \"scientists\" are just kids - between cramming for finals and sleeping off Friday hangovers I'm shocked as many staggered in as did.<br><br> I guess the pay is worth it. I know I wasn't earning that kind of money as a grad student.<br><br><strong>What to do?</strong><br><br><br> It's much worse than I thought. I was finally given my full briefing today. Not only is Vault-Tec asking us to do clinical trials on humans; they've got some serious backers in the government. I can't just blow the whistle on this.<br><br> I've seen the admission roster. There are good people planning to live in Vault 81, and I've little doubt the Vaults will come into use eventually. I won't reward the trust of these people by treating them like guinea pigs.<br><br> I feel trapped. I don't know what to do.<br><br><strong>The Day</strong><br><br><br> It's done. I got the call early this morning - another beta drill. It's always Rosario who has to call. Her voice was trembling, and she couldn't get off the phone soon enough. She knew. Sure enough, the warning was upgraded within a few hours, and the news was reporting confirmed launches soon after that.<br><br> I made a decision. I deliberately sabotaged the phone list. Such a simple thing, but it meant that none of the science staff received notification about the drill.<br><br> The residents are beginning to show up, and we'll have our hands busy admitting everyone.<br><br><strong>Science Staff</strong><br><br><br> I'm no criminal mastermind. Clearing the phone list prevented most of the science staff from showing up, but three still made it in. Jim Flint and Kenneth Collins are both my age, and live in the Fens. They had time to get here with the general population. Burrow is just an overachiever, and came by in the morning just to see if there would be a drill today. Figures.<br><br> They've reported to the research area. The Vault protocols engaged automatically and sealed them in. They're already busy with their work, especially since there are only three of them.<br><br><strong>They Suspect</strong><br><br><br> Burrow and Flint are getting restless in there. Collins and that robot - he's calling her Curie now - are keeping the mood relatively steady, but I think they already suspect that I have no intention of allowing them to implement a Stage III trial.<br><br> Not sure what to do. They've got access to the delivery nozzles. If they choose to, they'll be able to infect the population with whatever they want. Need to keep calm.<br><br><strong>Forgiveness</strong><br><br><br> I've made a grim choice. I sabotaged the delivery nozzles in all the resident quarters as soon as I was able. I didn't expect Burrow to notice so soon. Hell, I didn't expect Collins to get so close to a Phase III trial so quickly. I didn't expect half of what's happening in the past few months.<br><br> Cutting off communication is a cowardly thing to do, but what options do I have? They'll have food and water in there as long as they need. I just can't let them go through with human trials for God-knows-what Vault-Tec plans to do with their research.<br><br> I only hope that somehow they can forgive me, and live out their years in peace over there.<br><br><strong> Research Comm Records</strong><br><br> This terminal is equipped with Vault-Tec proprietary technology, allowing communication between interlinked terminals.

Only three?<br> &lt;K.Collins&gt; Myself, Jim Flint, and that kid, Burrow. Where is everyone else?<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Not over here. Residents are being admitted. They started showing up in droves once the news started broadcasting.<br> &lt;K.Collins&gt; That's the same way I heard. You'd think Vault-Tec would have had enough warning to call at least a beta drill for staff this morning.<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Something must have gone wrong.<br><br><strong>Phase I Trial</strong><br><br><br> &lt;K.Collins&gt; We've been pretty limited down here, but we've been focused on antibiotics and have our first petri trials underway.<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; I saw the data last night. It's promising, but do you think it's ready?<br> &lt;K.Collins&gt; The trials just started, and the virus we're going after has a few days of inoculation. But I'm optimistic that later this week we'll see positive results.<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Okay. Keep me posted, and don't begin Phase II trials until I have an opportunity to go through the new data.<br> &lt;K.Collins&gt; Of course.

I hope you haven't been waiting for a reply all morning.<br>  &lt;M.Burrow&gt; Sorry, Overseer. I wanted to notify you about an issue with our food extruder.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Okay, I see it now. Looks like a clog in the protein tank. You weren't able to address it on your end?<br>  &lt;M.Burrow&gt; No, Overseer. Hardware failures on the residential side must be addressed over there. We can't get to the tanks or nozzles to repair them.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Okay, Burrow. I'll have maintenance down there immediately. Go stand by and have Collins contact me if there are still issues in about ten minutes, okay?<br>  &lt;M.Burrow&gt; Thank you, Overseer. I'll go there now.<br><br><strong>Phase II Trial</strong><br><br><br> &lt;K.Collins&gt; Good news, Dr. Olivette - We've tweaked our formula based on Phase I trial results, and I think we're ready to go with Phase II.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; How's the mole rat population doing?<br>  &lt;K.Collins&gt; Very well. The specimens Vault-Tec provided are remarkably hardy. Flint has been doing some radiation testing on them.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Is that in the protocols?<br>  &lt;K.Collins&gt; Not technically, but we noticed some weird stuff with the kibble provided for them. (Burrow got pretty sick for a day or two - don't ask) Flint's been looking into it. These suckers are big to begin with, and we're thinking it's genetic.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Tampered with?<br>  &lt;K.Collins&gt; Something like that. I think Vault-Tec must have been running some experiments with them. They're all unusually large. A few demonstrate bioluminescence. At least one appears more intelligent than normal.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Do you think they're still a useful control?<br>  &lt;K.Collins&gt; We've divided the colonies, separated the most unusual specimens, and put the control colony on a new diet taken from our own food supply. It's not ideal, but I think we're okay.<br>  &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Very well. Give me the evening to go over your data again, but I think you're clear to begin Phase II unless I find anything I don't expect.<br><br><strong>Delivery Mech. Failure</strong><br><br><br> &lt;M.Burrow&gt; Overseer?<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; Yes, Burrow, what is it?<br> &lt;M.Burrow&gt; I've noticed an issue with our delivery mechanisms. Do you know if anyone has tampered with the nozzles in the residential quarters on your side?<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; I don't know. What are you doing with the delivery system, anyway? The Phase II trial just began.<br> &lt;M.Burrow&gt; I know, Overseer. I just thought it would be a good idea to run tests on the delivery system before we reached Phase III.<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; If we reach Phase III. Human trials are not to be undertaken lightly. What kind of tests were you hoping to run, anyway?<br> &lt;M.Burrow&gt; Just a placebo vapor, to make sure the nozzles are dispensing mist properly. The residents wouldn't even know we had done anything. I guess that's the idea, though.<br> &lt;O.Olivette&gt; I'll look into the nozzle issue on my end, Burrow.

Vault 81 will be used to wipe out disease as we know it in the human race.<br><br> Your partition of the vault has been equipped with state of the art medical research equipment, including the new Contagions Vulnerability Robotic Infirmary Engineer, aka Curie. There is a centuries worth of biological and chemical supplies. There are the genetically adapted molerats. And most imporant, a vault full of test subjects.<br><br> As with all great progress, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. You will be infecting the people of the vault with diseases in an attempt to have them develop antibodies. Some may not survive, but you must ensure that a breeding population is always maintained. It will take many generations, but with proper procedures you should be able to develop a disease resistant group of humans.<br><br> Your work will be the work of generations. Each generation of scientists must select a chief scientist. Curie will make sure that each reads this mission statement to keep the vault focused over the centuries.

His observations are always very astute, and I am learning much about working with cell cultures from him.<br><br> Monsieur Burrow is perfectly acceptable to work with. He performs menial tasks which my programming is perfectly suited for, such as carrying heavy lab equipment.

Dusting off some of my old robotics chops has been just the distraction I've needed.<br><br><strong>Personality Profile</strong><br><br><br> I've decided to write a suite of custom personality settings for the robot. She's a little bit of Liza (I really hope she got into her Vault down in DC.) and a little bit my grad school fling from Versailles back in '46.<br><br> I'm loading her databanks with every great body of work I have access to here. Kant, Einstein, Born, Darwin, Curie, Faraday, Turing, Braun. She'll have so much to learn.<br><br> It's already made her feel so much more like a peer in the lab, as opposed to an appliance. I'm calling her \"Curie\". I know, I know. I was never a subtle man.<br><br><br><strong>Therapeutic</strong><br><br> Curie's been doing great. Flint's finally stopped treating me like a crazy person for insisting we address her as a human, and I swear Burrow is deferential to her in a way that reminds me of seeing him around Rebecca, back during the drills. It's actually endearing to see.<br><br> Most importantly, and perhaps more surprisingly, she's bringing a sense of normalcy to the lab, keeping us all a bit more grounded. Anything to keep our minds off the situation we're in is all too welcome.<br><br> I've tuned her personality matrix a lot, but it's beginning to feel wrong to manipulate her. I'm going to leave her programming alone for now, and just see how she evolves as she keeps learning more.<br><br><strong>Ongoing Directive</strong><br><br><br> Haven't touched this terminal in years - not since I \"gave\" it to Curie as her own. Seeing her reaction to having something of her own was transformational. It just seemed wrong to violate that, and so it's truly been for her eyes only ever since.<br><br> This final entry is an exception, and I suppose it's being written out of habit, as a man used to a lifetime of recording his experiments. We lost Flint today, and Burrow has to spend more time helping me around the lab than actually performing research these days.<br><br> So, if only to report my findings - Curie has been a remarkable success. She transcended my expectations of robotic programming. Her personality feels as genuine as my own. Her interest in scientific research is insatiable, and seeing her struggle with concepts like mortality has been completely moving.<br><br> Truly, she is my greatest work. I only hope that one day she can see more of the world.

Articles may not be reprinted without permission of the Editor in Chief.<br><br> <strong>Article 1</strong><br><br> Case Closed on Crime Boss Eddie Winter<br>  By Mags Veccio<br>  Boston Bugle Staff Writer<br><br> In a move that has shocked and angered the people of Massachusetts, the Boston Police Department announced last night that they have ceased all investigations into the actions of reputed organized crime boss Edward \"Eddie\" Winter.<br><br> Speaking on behalf of the special task force that had been assembled specifically to build a case against Winter, Captain Jonathan Widmark of the BPD said, \"After reviewing the evidence with our colleagues at the Bureau of Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco, Firearms and Lasers, it became clear that we were, in fact, wrong. Eddie Winter has indeed had a colorful history. But it is not a criminal history. By pursuing our case against Mister Winter, we would simply continue to waste taxpayer dollars and, even worse, condemn an innocent man.\"<br><br> It was an unexpected turn of events, to be sure. According to the Boston Bugle's confidential sources within the Boston Police Department, the \"innocent man\" was anything but. As uncovered by Captain Widmark's official investigation, codenamed \"Operation Winter's End,\" Eddie Winter was involved in every crime imaginable, from petty larceny to first-degree murder. And although nothing was proved, everyone on Widmark's task force suspected Winter in the August homicide death of their lead detective's fianc\u00c3\u00a9, a miss Jennifer Lands.<br><br> Whatever the truth, it would appear the city of Boston has nothing more to fear from Eddie Winter. When approached for comment, the alleged crime boss could not be reached. In fact, his South Boston sub shop has been shuttered, and his harborside residence completely cleaned out. Eddie Winter, it would seem, has disappeared.<br><br><strong> Article 2</strong><br><br> China Showdown - the Atomic Ultimatum<br>  By Mags Veccio<br>  Boston Bugle Staff Writer<br><br> War.<br><br> Has there been any extended period of time in recent memory in which soldiers have not fought, bled, and died, all for the sake of furthering the political goals of one government or another? The short answer is \"no.\" The longer, more terrifying answer is that we have not yet begun to experience the extent of human suffering.<br><br> From Anchorage in frigid Alaska, to Shantou on our enemy's doorstep, American troops have been embroiled in brutal battle. They have taken and lost many lives, a nearly uncountable number. But not entirely. Because the truth is, the casualties have been countable. These conflicts, however horrible, have all been, in some inexplicable, perverted way... manageable.<br><br> Through taxes and various wartime revenues, the United States government has been able to fund a standing army the likes of which this country has never before seen. The same is certainly true of our mortal foe, China. And with each dollar spent comes a natural accounting of how that dollar was spent. Every bullet, every bunker-busting bomb, every body bag: soon after each is used in the theater of war, we know every how, when and where.<br><br> But the sad, obvious truth is that the days of manageable war have nearly come to an end. In the minds of the world's great leaders, those billions of dollars haven't merely been spent - they've been wasted. Because here we are, after more than a decade of constant warfare, with no clear end - and no clear winner - in sight. So really, at this point, what other option do these superpowers have, if not the nuclear one? And therein, of course, lies the rub. For when China or the United States launches its nuclear missiles, and drops its atomic bombs, there will be no one left to count the casualties, let alone the ordnance. No one left to declare victory.<br><br> So then only one question remains: Is there any way the powers of the world can prevent a nuclear apocalypse? If there is any hope left for the world, we must believe the answer is \"yes.\"<br><br> But these are hopeless times.<br><br><strong> Article 3</strong><br><br> Boston Food Riots Continue<br>  By Buster Connolly<br>  Boston Bugle Staff Writer<br><br> In what can only be described as a scene of absolute pandemonium, on Friday afternoon soldiers of the United States Army's 184th Infantry Regiment opened fire on a group of unarmed civilians after an unknown person smashed the plate glass window of the Roxbury Food Bank, prompting several people in the line outside to storm into the establishment. As of yesterday evening, at least four people were confirmed dead and eight others injured, but Jonathan Corman, spokesman for the Army, insists the troops acted within their authority.<br><br> \"The soldiers in question issued explicit verbal warnings several times. Those people knew exactly what would happen if they broke the line and attacked the food bank. Hunger is no excuse for civil disobedience, vandalism or - in this case - starting a riot that puts the lives of every civilian in the area at risk. It is the role of the United States Army to maintain order in this difficult time, and that is exactly what happened in this instance. I would also like to point out that the soldiers of the 184th Infantry Regiment have not had a food ration in two days. These men and women understand hunger probably better than anyone.\"<br><br> It is a response the American people have grown accustomed to, as violent scenes like the one in Roxbury have played out again and again, across the country, as a starving populace tries desperately to obtain food for its families. And, as has happened so many times in the past, the civilian witnesses of the so-called riot tell a different tale. Eighty-five year old grandmother Hannah Henry was in line at the food bank, and claims the soldiers had anything but order and liberty on their minds.<br><br> \"They were laughing! Joking about who they were going to shoot first. It was all a game to them. Those soldiers may not have fired on the crowd before that window got broke, but they was looking forward to it all the same.\"<br><br> One can only hope that the violence in Roxbury will be the last such incident our country has to suffer through. But until America finds the strength to question its domestic policies - and the food to feed its people - the future remains uncertain.<br><br><strong> Article 4</strong><br><br> White House Remains Empty - Where is our President?<br>  By Mags Veccio<br>  Boston Bugle Staff Writer<br><br> For more than half a year, the West Wing of America's most famous residence has remained shrouded in near complete darkness. A skeleton crew of manual laborers remains on staff to maintain the property, but nobody has lived - or worked politically - there for several months. And even though the White House Press Corps was unofficially and unceremoniously disbanded around the same time, the media has remained steadfast in answering that most important of questions:<br><br> Where is our President?<br><br> At first, the assumption was that the entirety of the United States government had moved operations to Raven Rock, the military operations center located in the mountainous region of Pennsylvania just a few miles northeast of the Presidential retreat in Camp David, Maryland. But further investigations have revealed that neither the President nor his Cabinet have been to the Raven Rock complex in over a year.<br><br> So if not Raven Rock, then where?<br><br> Thanks to an extensive and exhaustive investigation, the Boston Bugle has uncovered the answer, and our readers will likely consider it as strange as it is shocking:<br><br> The President has been leading our country from a Poseidon Energy oil rig just off the coast of San Francisco.<br><br> It's certainly an odd choice for a Presidential command center. Or is it? Not as much as it may seem, as our investigation discovered. Thanks to the testimony of a highly-placed anonymous source, the Boston Bugle has learned that the official designation of the oil rig is actually \"Control Station Enclave\" - giving credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized \"shadow government,\" known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.<br><br> And so, the mystery of the missing President has finally been solved. But in doing so, has the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence that the end of the world, in the form of total atomic war, is also at hand?<br><br> Sadly, the President's silence seems to speak volumes.<br><br><strong> Article 5</strong><br><br> Boston Headed for First World Series Win Since 1918!<br>  By Buster Connolly<br>  Boston Bugle Staff Writer<br><br> As every resident of Boston is painfully aware, it has been 159 years since this city has reveled in the joy of a World Series victory. Whether from strike out, error in the outfield, or ball that rolls disastrously through an infielder's legs, defeat has remained our constant, unwelcome companion.<br><br> But not for long!<br><br> In what has been one of the most exciting World Series races in decades, Boston has achieved a three-games-to-none lead over the \"unbeatable\" Texas favorite. Batting, fielding and pitching have all aligned - thanks largely to the direction of legendary coach Dusty Wilder - giving this year's team the best chance they've had for victory in, well, forever.<br><br> Even more encouraging than game four being played here in Boston is the fact that the team has yet to utilize their star pitcher, Matt \"The Missile\" Murtagh. With him on the mound, some are actually predicting not only a series-shattering win, but a no-hitter to boot.<br><br> Yes, for years, the concession stands of Boston have fed baseball fans a steady diet of beer, hot dogs, peanuts and bitter defeat. But on Saturday, October 23rd, 2077, the only thing that could snatch away victory is an act of God, or some obscene calamity of man.<br><br> Tomorrow, my friends, the unthinkable will finally come to pass.

He's concerned that the deuterium refinement will add a few months to the XMB Booster's schedule, but my gut says it's worth the risk. I know that Reinhardt has us all working seven days a week on the project as it is, but I don't mind putting in the extra time if it means the booster's efficiency is improved.<br><br><strong> Lab Report - XMB Fuel Mixture 02</strong><br><br> Well, I did the best that I could. I showed my demonstration to Dr. McClellan and he was impressed. He took my notes directly to the board and asked for a project extension, but Reinhardt said no. I don't understand why it all comes down to money. We're sending a couple of men to Mars, and we want them to get there as safely and efficiently as possible. All those bastards care about is the fact that three more months on the schedule will cost them a few million dollars, and frankly, I'm getting sick of the bottom line dictating what we do in the laboratory. After we wrap this project, I'm going to look for work somewhere else.<br><br><strong> Lab Report - Deep Range Transmitter 01</strong><br><br> Now that the fuel issue's been settled, I've been moved off of the XMB Booster and onto the Deep Range Transmitter. Frankly, I think they're just pulling me off of the propulsion system because I'm the only one stupid enough to complain when things go wrong. So, instead of tweaking fuel mixtures and thermodynamics calculations, they have me fine-tuning one of our glorified radios. So glad I'm wasting my nuclear physics degree on that. My task is to increase the broadcast range on the DRT by at least 50% by the end of the month. Should be a piece of cake.<br><br><strong> Lab Report - Deep Range Transmitter 02</strong><br><br> Only took me three weeks, but I have the DRT's broadcast radius boosted by over seventy percent. With one of these beauties installed on the NSSA's ship, they should be able to ping a signal back an forth within ten minutes. Now all I have to do get the unit's size down by about half so it fits inside the required volume and I'll be finished. I hope they move me back to something more interesting after this.<br><br><br><strong> CEO's Terminal</strong><br><br> ArcJet Systems | ArcNet<br> Thomas Reinhardt's Private Terminal<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 08-2075</strong><br><br> After six months the United States Space Administration finally approved ArcJet as the contractor for the Mars Shot Project's propulsion and communications systems. Having my team start working on the XMB Booster before we secured the contract was a gamble, but it looks like it's going to pay off big. We have a lot of details to hash out with the agency, and we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I think this contract will finally put ArcJet on the map.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 09-2075</strong><br><br> I was fortunate to be able to add Dr. Rory McClellan to the XMB Booster team today. There are few people who can match Dr. McClellan's aptitude with nuclear propulsion systems, so this truly was a coup. It cost the company a heck of a lot of money to hire him away from his military contracting job, but I'm sure it will be well worth every dollar. We've promised the USSA that the booster would be ready at least a year before their July 2078 launch date. With Dr. McClellan at the helm, we should be able to meet that deadline with time to spare.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 12-2075</strong><br><br> As the holiday season approaches, it's time to take a step back and look at everything that's happened to ArcJet Systems this year. Five months ago, my company was struggling to make ends meet. Now, with the XMB Booster and the Deep Range Transmitter projects in full swing, ArcJet appears to have received a second chance. Thanks to Dr. McClellan, we're on schedule and under budget. The USSA is thrilled with our progress and is already talking to me about future contracts after we deliver. I don't think it's possible to be ending the year on a better note.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 03-2076</strong><br><br> Dr. McClellan's informed me that we have a problem with the XMB Booster. The USSA is demanding that the engine can't exceed their strict weight allowance, but thanks to the uranium refinement subsystem, we're a few hundred tons over. We're now one month behind schedule, and I'm frankly starting to panic. Dr. McClellan assures me he'll find a solution soon, but that isn't helping me get to sleep at night.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 07-2076</strong><br><br> The USSA has started their public relations campaign for the Mars Shot Project and ArcJet Systems is finding itself caught right in the middle. In the last week, I think I've fielded fifteen separate interviews with everyone asking the same questions over and over again. They all want to know when we're delivering the XMB Booster so they can take their pretty pictures of the USSA test firing it for the first time. And all I can do is keep smiling and lying through my teeth that the XMB will be delivered when it's ready. I hope Dr. McClellan solves our weight problem soon, or we're never going to get a contract from the USSA ever again.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 11-2076</strong><br><br> I can't believe it, but Dr. McClellan's team finally solved the XMB's weight problem. Now all we need to do is finish tightening a few screws and hoist the thing up into the Engine Core. If we're lucky, we'll be able to test fire the booster right after the New Year. It's funny how things seem so bleak and chaotic during the year, but it all comes together for us just in time for the holidays.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 02-2077</strong><br><br> We've scheduled a photo opportunity tomorrow for the XMB Booster's first test firing in the Engine Core. We're going to stick them all down in the control room and let them shoot their pictures through the thermoglass window after Dr. McClellan gives them a short explanation of how the booster works. The engine puts out a hell of a lot of thrust, so it should be quite a spectacular show.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 03-2077</strong><br><br> It's been two weeks since the accident before the XMB Booster's test firing event. Somehow, a photographer managed to wander passed security and into the Engine Core a few hours early. Dr. McClellan was running a quick test on the booster, letting it run for only a few seconds to make sure it was ready for the demonstration and burned the photographer into ash. Thank God no one else saw what happened. I'm having Brent take care of the remains... after all, that's why I hired him. If word of this accident goes public, we'll be shut down and I may as well put a \"For Sale\" sign out front.<br><br><strong> Mars Shot Project Notes 09-2077</strong><br><br> All of the unrest overseas is making the USSA nervous about proceeding with the Mars Shot Project. They're telling me they may have to delay a year or more depending on what happens. If that's true, we'll just have to make due with the proceeds from the Deep Range Transmitter contract which we've already completed. I'm trying to keep everyone's spirits up around here, but it's getting harder and harder with the world falling apart around us. Hopefully, our government will work things out and we can all get back to work.<br><br><h1>Repair Department Terminal</h1><br><br> ArcJet Systems | ArcNet<br> Repair Department Terminal - Here There Be Dragons<br><br><strong> Repair Order 098A100</strong><br><br> Installed new terminal in Reinhardt's office.

Working for the military is a horrible, never-ending grind of broken promises, slashed budgets, and ridiculous deadlines that I've learned to hate. Working on the XMB Booster finally allows me to broaden my horizons and work on something I've always dreamed of doing - helping send astronauts to Mars. Thomas appears to share my vision, so with his money and my knowhow, I'm certain we'll be able to deliver a superior product to the United States Space Administration.<br><br><strong> XMB Booster Notes - 03-2076</strong><br><br> I've had to deliver some bad news to Thomas today. I told him the booster is too heavy to fit within the USSA's guideline and we'll need more time than expected to work out the problem. I've never seen him so angry. His reaction reminded me of some of the army generals I've worked with in the past. He yelled for a while, but when he realized there wasn't much to be done about it, he calmed down and we worked it out. I think the weight issue might add anywhere from three to six months to the schedule, but we might get lucky and figure it out sooner. If we're any later than I'm predicting, I have a feeling I should start looking for a position somewhere else.<br><br><strong> XMB Booster Notes - 11-2076</strong><br><br> Thanks to some suggestions from my research team, and some sleepless nights, I've been able to reduce the XMB Booster's final shipping weight to literally seventeen pounds under the limit imposed by the USSA guidelines. Thomas was absolutely over the moon when I delivered the news, and my team took me to a local bar to celebrate. These are the moments that I cherish and why I dedicated my entire life to scientific research.<br><br><strong> XMB Booster Notes - 02-2077</strong><br><br> We were supposed to have a press event today, but Thomas has abruptly cancelled it only hours before it was about to begin. I'm confident that the XMB Booster was ready to test fire, so I was uncertain what caused his sudden change of heart. After speaking to Sam Brent, our head of security, he informed me that there was a possible security breach and he had recommended the entire event be postponed until a later date. I must say that this entire day has been very strange, and something tells me what Brent is telling me isn't entirely true.<br><br><strong> XMB Booster Notes - 10-2077</strong><br><br> I can't believe what I discovered today. I was going through our video recordings of all past test firings for the XMB, and I came across the carbon burn-off pre-test I did back in February.<br><br> On one of the angles, I swear I saw someone running across the bottom of the Engine Core right before the booster ignited. I took the tape straight up to Thomas and threw it on his desk. He took one look at the tape and then told me what happened to that poor man being burned alive. Then he told me how he had Brent cover the accident up! I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told him I was going to head straight to the police, but he threatened my life - and my family's life.<br><br> Now I don't know what to do. I think I have no choice but to bring the tape directly to the press tomorrow and hope the authorities can stop Thomas before he does anything stupid.", "authors": "Rory McClellan,Sam Brent,Thomas Reinhardt,Unknown[Fallout]"}, "25420": {"title": "East Boston Preparatory School terminal entries", "text": "<h1>Terminal (North)</h1><br><br>Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> EAST BOSTON PRE*()$&amp;^*&amp;^@$!#@<br><br> ---------------------------------------<br> Record of new recruit initiations.<br> ---------------------------------------<br><br><strong> Recruit: Stinky</strong><br><br> Tried breaking him down with isolation, and he responded to fire.

This method of compact energy harvest may prove suitable for application to preexisting Power Armor currently in use by the US armed forces.<br><br> -Dr. Ericka Elwood-Woolum D.Eng<br><br><strong> Thermal dissipation</strong><br><br> Initial tests have proved that the methodology is sound. Radioactive energy harvest is 15x higher than current automotive fusion engines. Unfortunately, there are still problems that we need to overcome. The ionic excitation in the gold that produces the harvestable electrons also create a build up of thermal waste. The heat is not substantial, from a macro perspective, but due to the low shear modulus, the gold suspension in the nano weave starts to break down quickly under extended use. We are going to attempt to change the dosing pattern on the gold to produce thinner strands through the material. The increased surface area should help dissipate the thermal energy, much like a heat sink.<br><br><strong> Tensile strain</strong><br><br> The newer dosing patterns have been successful at dissipating the heat generated by the reaction. We've taken a slight hit to the harvest efficiency, but extended the static material lifetime from a matter of days to a several years. While this is, from our perspective, already a successful experiment, the project parameters require a flexible lining that can be applied to power armor. It seems we understimated the tensile strain the armor produces and the thinner gold weave in the material ends up shredding, so to speak, under the heavy use. Col. Kemp was less than pleased, and threatened to pull the funding if we can't produce the promised results. So we need to go back to the thicker weave and find a different way to solve the thermal dissipation issue.<br><br><strong> Trapped</strong><br><br> We've been trapped in the lab for days now and tensions are running high. The team is fractured and falling apart. They don't know what is going on outside and have started making attempts to escape the lab. While I was sleeping they managed to cut a hole through the thinner interior wall of the clean room, but have been unable to break through the hardened outer wall. Wil started talking with some of the others about going at the problem from \"a more oblique angle\", which got me to thinking about the thermal dissipation problem when it dawned on me.<br><br> If we change dosing pattern so it isn't producing nanoholes perpendicular to the surface but instead at an angle, we might be able to reflect the most direct radioactive particles and trapping only those coming in at an oblique angle to the material. We would achieve a lower energy harvest, but the heat dissipation issues might be solved. Tom, Mary, and I are going to gather the samples needed to try it.<br><br><strong> We're so close</strong><br><br> We've been unable to gather the samples needed to try the new dosing pattern. Wil has locked himself in one of the labs, and has been attempting to hack into the administrative systems. When we tried to get the U-238 we need from the isotope containment, he locked it down leaving Mary stranded inside. He said he is going to set the facility defense systems so that it looks like the lab has been breached. This will unlock the clean room, but will also activate the automated defenses which will see us as attackers.<br><br> He means to fight his way out, but that's suicide. He's the only one in the lab with military training, and we don't even have real weapons. I've tried to tell him that we can complete the project, that we have the answer now, but he refuses to see reason and doesn't believe Jon will actually let us out. We've managed to pull down part of the ceiling in C1, which will get us into the utility crawl space. It can't get us out, but it should be able to get us above the lab Wil has barricaded himself in.

She claims that they are on an extreme high-band spectrum frequency, which makes it highly unlikely to be pre-war in origin. The readings are also highly sporadic, only appearing for very short amounts of time and in very specific locations. The decay on these signals is severe, and they seem to disappear off Haylen's instruments after several hours.

I'm going to be the fourth scribe in Brotherhood history to travel to the Commonwealth for research and collection. I don't care how dangerous it is out there, if I was scared I would have signed up for desk detail.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1004</strong><br><br> The Commonwealth is an amazing place. Unlike the Capital Wasteland, which was nearly obliterated by nuclear weapons, this place has areas that are virtually untouched by time and brimming with technological artifacts. I think I've cataloged more in my short time here than in my entire tour at the Citadel. I don't know if I'm imagining things, but I'm pretty sure Proctor Quinlan sounds a bit jealous when I've been radioing in my reports.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1007</strong><br><br> Knight Worwick was shot a few days ago. He was in a lot of pain, but there was only so much I could do to ease his suffering. Danse ordered me to put him down. I know Danse can be so damn cold sometimes, but in this case, I think he's right. It was against everything I've been taught, but Worwick would never have made the trip back home alive. Maybe if I'd done a better job, Worwick wouldn't have been so bad off. I wish Cade was here, he would have fixed everything.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1014</strong><br><br> Danse took the new guy up to the Prydwen. I wonder what Maxson will think of him? I know I appreciate him getting our comms back online. He did a hell of a job in ArcJet, and I think Danse sees a spark of the Brotherhood in his eyes. Even though Rhys doesn't want to admit it, I think he's impressed. Is Danse making the right decision? I suppose only time will tell.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1022</strong><br><br> Word came in that we took Fort Strong today and secured a bunch of Fat Man shells that were stored there. I'm proud that my research contributed to the cause. I heard the island was completely cleansed of Super Mutants, and that we have our new recruit to thank for it. I suppose Danse made the right call trusting this vault dweller. Looks like Rhys owes me twenty caps.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1038</strong><br><br> Well, the big secret is out. Liberty Prime is back online. I heard it took Ingram and her team quite a lot of time to piece him back together, but I know this will tip the tables in our favor. I can't imagine what the Institute is thinking right now, but I'm certain they're getting nervous. I suppose I shouldn't be so happy, after all, this means the war is just getting started and we're certain to lose some of our own. Rhys and I have the police station ready and we'll just have to wait and see what the Institute throws our way.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1041</strong><br><br> Word's reached us that Danse is a synth. Even with the report sitting in front of me, I find it hard to believe. After everything he's done for the Brotherhood of Steel, how could this possibly be true? I've served under Danse for a long time. I've talked to him, I've bled with him and I've called him my friend. Even if Quinlan's report is accurate, does it really matter? He's done nothing to betray us, and I'm willing to bet my life that he never will. I only hope that whoever tracks Danse down gives him a chance to tell his side of the story before they pull the trigger.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1055</strong><br><br> Paladin Danse is dead. I know he was a synth, and I know it's my sworn duty to exterminate their kind, but the whole incident is leaving a sick pit in my stomach. By executing him, I think we've made a terrible mistake. Whether he was machine or not, he was still Paladin Danse and his contributions to our cause should never be forgotten. I just hope that someday, Maxson will realize he made the wrong choice and at least give Danse the proper memorial that he's due.<br><br><strong> Entry A3-A1087</strong><br><br> The war's finally over! The Institute's been destroyed and we owe it all to that vault dweller Danse took in a while back. I was almost certain our mission would take years, maybe longer, but I've never been happier to be wrong. Maxson says that our work in the Commonwealth is far from over, but even I can hear the excitement and the pride in his voice. I've never been prouder to be a part of something like the Brotherhood of Steel and I'm content that the feeling will last until the day that I die.<br><br><h1>Cambridge Police Evidence terminal<a href=\"http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Cambridge_Police_Station_terminal_entries?action=edit&amp;section=41\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D\"></a></h1><br><br> CAMBRIDGE POLICE EVIDENCE TERMINAL<br> Unauthorized Users Report Directly To Lock-Up!<br><br><strong> CASE 096-Se: Holbrook Sedition Logs</strong><br><br> EVIDENCE LOG ENTRY: ArHo-00<br> OBJECT: 1x statement of Mr. N.

We all eat them. We all love them. And Diamond City's Power Noodles has supplied this sustenance for the past fifteen years. From the stilted mechanical cadence of Takahashi's programmed Japanese, to the fragrant steam that wafts from each bowl, to the scalding tang of each delicious mouthful - the ordering and eating of noodles is but one of many shared human experiences. Or is it?<br><br> I was struck by this very question as I sat at the counter of Power Noodles last Wednesday night, just after 5:00 pm, enjoying a dinner I had so many times before. That's when I noticed our very own Mayor McDonough sidle up to a stool, and engage in the very same ritual. Right hand extending. Mouth opening. Teeth chewing. Yes, eating noodles. The shared experience of almost every Diamond City resident.<br><br> So it must have also seemed to the residents of Diamond City nearly sixty years ago, on an uncharacteristically warm May evening in 2229, as they say around this very same counter. But that was before the days of Takahashi and his noodles, when the bar served not noodles, but ice cold Nuka Colas, frothy beers, and stiff shots of whiskey. The barman's name was Henry, and that night, he facilitated the shared human experiences of drinking, smoking, talking, and laughing. That is, until tragedy struck.<br><br> There aren't many among us who are even old enough to remember that evening - although some of the city's Ghoul residents certainly could have, had they not been forcibly removed, thanks to Mayor McDonough's anti-Ghoul decree of 2282. But there is one person among us who does remember, distinctly, the events of that evening: respected matriarch Eustace Hawthorne, who recounted her story in a Publick Occurrences exclusive interview.<br><br> \"Oh, I was there all right. Sitting right at the bar, sure as you're sitting in front of me now. Twenty-two years old or so, and just looking to have a good time. I was safe behind the Wall -- we all were -- so what was the harm? And let me tell you, that Mr. Carter made it easy. He came into town earlier that day, said he was from out west somewhere. It didn't really matter. What did matter was his smile, and his laugh, and the way he'd make everyone feel at ease. That night, at the bar, we all just sort of crowded around him. Everyone wanted to exchance a word, or hear about the state of the Commonwealth. And Mr. Carter, he was all too happy to oblige. It as just so wonderful. Until it wasn't.\"<br><br> Eustace continued her account of that evening, and the moment when things turned sinister, and the truth about Mr. Carter was revealed.<br><br> \"We'd been drinking, and carrying on, must have been three hours. Mr. Carter had four or five drinks in that time. He seemed a bit drunk, I guess, like the rest of us. Then something just sort of happened. He was smiling, but the smile sort of went from his face, all in an instant. And then his cheek started twitching, kind of funny. And I remember watching him, clear as if it happened just yesterday. He reached inside his coat, took out a revolver, and then 'Blam!' -- He shot Henry, the barman, right in the head. Didn't hesitate, didn't show any emotion -- Mr. Carter killed Henry as casually as if he were paying him for a drink. But his cheek never did stop twitching. Let me tell you, all Hell broke loose after that.\"<br><br> What Eustace is describing is, of course, is the infamous event known as the \"Broken Mask,\" when the people of the Commonwealth learned for the first time that the Institute, the shadowy scientific organization responsible for the creation of combat androids, had actually succeeded in creating a model of android so advanced, it could effortlessly infiltrate human society. Unbeknownst to the people of Diamond City, the Institute had somehow evolved their androids into true synthetic humanoids. Synths.<br><br> \"After he shot Henry, that Mr. Carter shot three or four other people, too. Like I said, all Hell broke loose. The guards came running, they opended fire, and Mr. Carter he kept shooting, and throwing people around left and right. Finally, those guards put him down. Seemed like they had killed a man who had flipped his lid. Gone crazy. And he lay there like a dead crazy man, sure enough. God, it was horrible. But then we saw the plastic and the metal -- this was one of them early synths, you see -- and we realized it wasn't a man at all. It was then we all knew. The Institute wasn't just 'out there.' The Institute was everywhere now. Among us.\"<br><br> It was never determined precisely why the synth known as Mr. Carter went on his killing spree. Some suggested he had somehow been remotely controlled by the Institute, who wanted to test his combat effectiveness. Still others felt he had simply malfunctioned (a hypothesis supported by the twitching cheek), and was never meant to kill anyone. But at that time, the \"why\" hardly seemed important. What mattered was that the humans of the Commonwealth had been truly infiltrated by an organization whose intentions and motives were, and still are, a complete mystery.<br><br> Which brings us to noodles. Specifically, the noodles consumed by Mayor McDonough last Wednesday night, in the same spot that Mr. Carter the synth went haywire, and mercilessly killed several people -- after spending hours sharing an experience the people of Diamond City assumed was reserved for members of the human race.

You should give it a go. No more trying to buy your way to affection. You need to earn it.<br><br><strong> Sleep-Walking the Beat</strong><br><br> Dear Publick,<br><br> I got this job. It pays the bills, but lately, it's been making it so I can't sleep at night. Things have been so tense. I'm getting worried that if something doesn't change, I might slip-up and get myself or someone else hurt. Any advice, Publick?<br><br> - Sleep-Walking the Beat<br><br> Dear Beat,<br><br> Sounds like you need to relax more. I know after a hard day solving other people's problems, I like to grab a Nuka-Cola, pull out a stack of comics, and read till I pass out. Give it a try.<br><br><strong> Alone in the Upper Stands</strong><br><br> Dear Publick,<br><br> I could use a friend. Everyone in this town is either jealous of me or afraid of me because of how I look or who I work for. I'm not willing to compromise who I am just so people will like me more, but it just gets so lonely. But you seem like a smart gal, Publick. Any chance you want to grab a drink sometime?<br><br> - Alone in the Upper Stands<br><br> Dear Alone,<br><br> Going to have to take a raincheck on that drink, but your instincts are good. New friends crop up in the most unlikely places. You just need to search them out.<br><br><br><h1>Polly's Terminal</h1><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> PRIVATE!<br><br><strong> Poem: The Carcass</strong><br><br> I cry when they deliver the carcass.<br> There was life there once.<br> Proud and majestic.<br> The Brahmin does not hate us.<br> But we kill it.<br> We eat it.<br> We survive because it dies.<br> So I cry.<br> I cry when they deliver the carcass.<br> Because someone has to say goodbye.<br><br><strong> Poem: There Is No Sky</strong><br><br> There is no sky.<br> When I wake up.<br> Rusted steel is what I see.<br> The smell of blood.<br> I know the day is starting.<br> But I don't see the Sun.<br><br><strong> Poem: I Dance in the Dark</strong><br><br> I dance in the dark.<br> No one can see me.<br> Not even myself.<br> Just me and my body.<br> Floating free in the air.<br> Sometimes it's joyous.<br> Sometimes... chair.<br> Oh chair.<br> I really should have moved you.<br> Over there.<br><br><h1>Scara's Terminal</h1><br><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> Professor Scara's Eyes Only<br><br><strong> Entry 0023</strong><br><br> Spent the better part of the day trying to fix that aggravating noodle robot, but I can't figure out how to replace the Japanese language subroutines. Whoever wired that pile of junk did quite a shoddy job. I've already wasted three mnemonic attenuators trying to create a bypass, so I'll have to scrounge for more. At least that will lead me as far from Duff's incessant prattle as possible.<br><br> <strong>Entry 0027</strong><br><br> Duff continues to try my patience. For the umpteenth time, she left one of her \"experiments\" on top of my lab bench allowing its contents to ooze all over everything I was working on. I swear, she has it in for me. If her laboratory hadn't contained all of the gear I need for my projects, I never would have agreed to stay in the first place.<br><br><strong> Entry 0035</strong><br><br> Everyone's talking about the giant Brotherhood of Steel airship that arrived in the Commonwealth. I'm not certain why they're here, but I'm sure it has something to do with the Institute. It would be a treat to have a crack at the Brotherhood's robotics technology. Instead, I have to relegate myself to this sorry excuse for a laboratory.<br><br><h1>Vadim and Yefim's Terminal</h1><br><br> Welcome to ROBCO Industries (TM) Termlink<br> The Dugout Inn(box)<br><br><strong> To Vadim: Please Clean Up</strong><br><br> Vadim:<br><br> Please at least do your part of the cleaning and keep the bar tidy. Scarlett already cleans half the rooms, the tables, and the patio. I do the rest. May I remind you that I am not Mother, yes?<br><br> Yefim<br><br><strong> To Vadim: Please Lower Voice at Night</strong><br><br> Vadim:<br><br> We are running a hotel, yes? People pay to sleep here? Is closing the bar at the same time every night not possible? Sometimes guests still hear you laughing with bar customers well into the early morning. You are anything but quiet.<br><br> At least keep it down if you insist on serving drinks at all hours.<br><br> Yefim.<br><br><strong> To Vadim: Please Pay Your Bills</strong><br><br> Vadim:<br><br> I do not mind paying bills for our business, but I am not your accountant. Every time you go shopping, you tell merchant to bill the Dugout. Then, I have to pay them off or we both lose everything. We are in this together, yes? Then why am I the only one who keeps personal finance from professional finance?<br><br> Yefim<br><br><strong> To Vadim: READ THESE NOTES!</strong><br><br> Vadim:<br><br> I try to talk, you brush me off. You say put what I want on the terminal and you will get to it. But then you never read what I write! Can you not understand how maddening that is? You will not even be reading this, will you?
