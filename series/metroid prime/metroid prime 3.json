We followed her teachings, and turned our vessel into a ship without peer. But more work remained! \n\nDark Samus required a mighty flagship, one to strike terror in the hearts of her enemies. The might of Colossus was not enough. She demanded more! Her solution was unique and most excellent. \n\nWe took her great star-beast and fitted it with cybernetic weapon systems. Crew quarters and command consoles were placed within the beast's skull. In time, we created a mighty dreadnaught, and called it Leviathan. The great leader was pleased.", "authors": "Unknown[Metroid Prime] "}, "13668": {"title": "Our Mission", "text": "Phazon was discovered two stellar years ago, and since that moment, Command has been driven to control it all. Two operations have been established, at tremendous cost. Both have failed, thanks to the accursed Hunter, Samus Aran. Her Federation allies now move to secure what little Phazon remains on the planet Aether. This we cannot allow. We, the crew of the battleship Colossus, swear to take that Phazon or die trying.", "authors": "Unknown[Metroid Prime] "}, "13669": {"title": "Disaster at Elysia", "text": "The march of the Hunter continues, much to our dismay. She has smashed our line at Elysia, taking down Commander Ghor in the process. The accursed Elysian machines were no match for Aran's guns, and now the Federation has control of their spy station once again. \n\nIt is only a matter of time before they find the location of the Phazon source and send their fleets to lay siege. Our great leader does not seem to mind these setbacks.

As we prepared for war with the hated Galactic Federation, she decided she required one of their great machines to better control her living planet. We then set out to bring an Aurora Unit to Dark Samus. \n\nBribes led us to the location of our prize: the battleship Valhalla. Crewed with green recruits on a training mission, she was ours for the taking. One of the mightiest ships in the cosmos was no match for the Phazon-powered weapons of the Colossus. We rendered Valhalla helpless, then sent raider to claim our prize. The Aurora was ours! \n\nThere was no mercy for the Federation dogs. At the command of Dark Samus, we jettisoned the crew into the frigid depths of space, leaving the wreck of Valhalla as a warning to the Federation.
