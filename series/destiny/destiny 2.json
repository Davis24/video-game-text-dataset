Today I fill the Y-goblet with praise for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign, so that my ancestors may know his generosity.\n\nI told him.\n\nHe has decided where he will make everything ready for death. The Leviathan&#39;s course is set for a far system, where the Traveler awaits. His Shadows are already on their way to kill Ghaul, or to die in the attempt. How could I betray him, in this time of endings, by keeping a secret he has asked to share?\n\nI went to him as he bathed in his royal pool, for his proxies are, of course, as exquisitely sensual as his old form. I shed my garments, there being no more taboo between us than between two animals, and sat beside him in the glow of his comfort.\n\n&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; I said, &quot;I kept a secret from you.&quot;\n\nI explained how I worshipped my ancestors and the sacred chalice that cupped their spirits. I admitted that I had put these beliefs before him in my heart. He listened as I told him how the ancient God-Thoughts of my people, the operant overlords who dominated our prehistory by sheer mental penetration, had exterminated my faith for daring to see a spark of the divine in every common person.\n\n&quot;Match,&quot; he said, &quot;you have committed a crime, and I will pass my sentence shortly. But first, let me ask you something. Do you think I made the right choice with the Clipse?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; I admitted.\n\n&quot;Because I ended so many lives?&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes, your Majesty.&quot;\n\n&quot;But knowing that they would soon end anyway, and that by killing most I could allow a small few to live in happiness rather than in strife... did I not choose the greatest possible good?&quot;\n\n&quot;I suppose, your Majesty, that my faith makes me see the shared suffering of the Clipse as... more fair than the survival of a happy few. If I were one of the Clipse, I would want a fair chance. Not judgment from on high.&quot;\n\nHe nodded in compassion. &quot;I know. I once tried to be fair too, Match. An empire of excess for every citizen, no matter their class or species of birth. It is good for a ruler to raise the standard by which his subjects live. But what if that ruler has found proof, absolute proof, that existence is a zero-sum game? That there is not enough time or energy to give everyone a fair life? Knowing that, mustn&#39;t we privilege a chosen few?&quot;\n\nI did not know and I admitted it.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s all right. I don&#39;t ask certainty.&quot; He shifted himself, sending waves across the pool. &quot;For a long time after the coup, I stared out into the infinite universe, and I saw... meaninglessness. In a universe that goes on forever, there must be an infinity of Caluses, all staring at the same blankness. How could I be a god if I was... generic?\n\n&quot;But now that I have seen what is coming, now that there is a limit to the time afforded to us... well, it may sound cruel, Match, but the less there is of everything else, the more I matter. I intend to be the last good thing in this world. I will gather my chosen companions and ease as much suffering as I can before the end. There are emperors who would take on any shape to escape death. I am not one. I am true to myself. And so, Match, are you.&quot;\n\nHe clapped me on the back with enormous gentleness. &quot;Your only crime, my councilor, was that you denied me the chance to give you a gift. Come. Show me the place you favor, and tell me the measurements you require. I will build you a temple so you can worship without fear. And all I ask is that you remember me in your prayers.&quot;", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29466": {"title": "IV.

Even disassembled, the Hive tower was intricate. Multi-layered. Woven metal latticework coiled in ever-tightening concentric cylinders. Each could spin independently within the larger housing. Maddeningly complex armatures were contained within, lubricated by gristly, living tissue.\n\nKosis had marked the Hive salvage specifically for the Spider&#39;s attention. It wouldn&#39;t be shipped off to marketplaces and storehouses like the remains of the Ketch&mdash;finds like this were of special interest to him. Kosis considered sending a missive ahead of the shipment but thought better of it. If she weren&#39;t there to present the find herself, another ambitious Vandal or Dreg might try and take the credit. Spider would probably promote the usurper strictly out of appreciation for their cunning.\n\nKosis was so focused on ensuring the safety of her salvage that she hadn&#39;t noticed Savek and the other Dregs running into camp from the direction of the cave. Kosis stood, Sword in hand, half-expecting a mutiny. But from the fear in Savek&#39;s eyes, Kosis quickly realized it was anything but.\n\n&quot;It returned!&quot; was all Savek could exclaim. The Dregs confirmed: the dismantled structure had regrown in a matter of hours. Kosis ordered the trio to lead her back to the site, to see it with her own eyes. A part of her yearned to see it again.\n\nMuch to Kosis&#39;s disbelief, their assertion was true. The structure stood as tall as ever, emanating its hideous green light. A pang of dread shook Kosis to the core. Her mind flooded with memories of childhood stories about the Whirlwind and the onslaught of the Hive.\n\n&quot;Leave it,&quot; she ordered. &quot;Leave it and do not return.&quot; It was a command, though one born of fear.\n\nThe tower whispered an unheard counteroffer into her subconscious.\n\n&lt;&gt;\n\n&lt;&gt;", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29467": {"title": "Of Earth and the Reef", "text": "Dear Master Ives,\n\nI write to you on behalf of the Cryptarchs of Earth in sympathy for all those who died in service to your Queen.

All of this scholarship would benefit from cross-reference and critical comparison with your own collected records.

That you would attempt to use our misfortune to solicit access to our vaults and records (which I assure you are far more extraordinary than whatever half-eaten corruptions you&#39;ve discovered among your ruins) is quite appalling. We will, however, happily review any data or records you believe would be of interest to our efforts. You&#39;ll also be curious to know that reams of new discoveries are being generated daily since your Traveler cast out the last of its Light to refuel your Guardians.

We don&#39;t know what&#39;s in there,&quot; I say to Ana, standing in front of the entrance to the Deep Stone Crypt.\n\nWe make our way through the war-torn lab. Eramis&#39;s siege before the Bombardment sure left its mark on the place. She found Darkness here and helped spread it like a plague on the world. Clovis almost did the same in his time.\n\n&quot;If I remember right, we have a long drop ahead of us. You better hang on to me,&quot; I say.\n\nShe wraps her arms over my shoulders, and it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve been close to a person in over 100 years. I can smell a trace of sodium tallowate. But only a trace. She hasn&#39;t bathed for a few days. She squeezes tight. I forgot what this felt like. My body produces a fleeting sensation of warmth.\n\nI move down the elevator shaft. We land as quietly as possible, remaining still. It&#39;s dead down here, but the power is on. Someone must have been here&hellip; or still is.\n\nAs we make our way through the eviscerated research center, I notice Ana taking it all in. She seems almost familiar with the space.\n\n&quot;Clovis was an animal, sure. But what he discovered and built is absolutely incredible,&quot; she breathes.\n\nNever heard her speak so highly of the old man. She forgets that I was there. Doesn&#39;t realize the hand he played in our future, even centuries ago.\n\n&quot;This way!&quot; she calls out, running ahead. After walking through several corridors, we come to a familiar dead end. It&#39;s still there. Clarity Control. I dreaded seeing this again. Practically a standing testament to all the bad that Clovis did.\n\nI want to get away from it, but Ana&#39;s fixated. &quot;Hey, you ready? We need to keep going,&quot; I say.\n\nShe snaps back to reality. &quot;Sorry.&quot;\n\nFinally, we find it. The place where Exos were born. Ana covers her nose as we&#39;re greeted with a rotten smell. Slowly, we turn the corner and see a decomposing corpse desperately clinging to a lever on a console. &quot;The Drifter&hellip;,&quot; Ana says. Hard to tell how long he&#39;s been here. We pry his hand from the console and carry him out of the room to try and purge the stench.\n\n&quot;What do you think he was doing here?&quot; I ask.\n\n&quot;Most likely the same thing we are,&quot; Ana says, plugging in her drive. &quot;But he failed. Probably for the best. He doesn&#39;t deserve another chance.&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s depressing, seeing him like that. All alone down here&hellip;\n\nAna works the console. &quot;Uploading now. Should be out of here soon. Grab that lever.&quot;\n\nI pull down, and a latch opens, releasing radiolarian fluid into an empty pool nearby. I catch Ana staring at the spot where we found the Drifter&#39;s body.\n\n&quot;You ever think about what we could have done differently?&quot; she poses.\n\nAll the time.\n\n&quot;Not really,&quot; I answer.\n\n&quot;So much of this death and destruction stems back to us, to our family. I know Clovis was responsible for a lot. He had a hand in bringing the Darkness to this world.&quot;\n\n&quot;How do you know that?&quot; I ask.\n\n&quot;I found a journal the last time I was here. It&#39;s old, and half the pages were torn out, but it had a lot of information about him that was salvageable.&quot;\n\nOf course, she&#39;s been here before. Clearly, she&#39;s not telling me the whole truth.\n\n&quot;What else was in it?&quot; I ask.\n\n&quot;Outside of the redacted memos and experiments, there were stories and recollections of our family. It&#39;s all from his perspective, so he was never the villain. But still, maybe he wasn&#39;t as bad as we thought. He seemed to care about us, in his way.&quot;\n\n&quot;Really?&quot;\n\n&quot;He did some good, Elsie.&quot;\n\n&quot;I was there, Ana. I saw the things he did. He was delusional. Of course, he was never the villain in his own story.&quot;\n\nWe sit for a while and wait in silence.\n\nThe pool begins to bubble. Ana jumps to her feet as a sleek metal hand emerges from the fluid. Slowly, the Exo rises. Silky liquid drips from the tendrils that conjoin the parts. Eventually, it takes its first steps out of the pool.\n\n&quot;Red?&quot; Ana asks timidly.\n\nIts head turns.

No child went unfed. No youth came of age illiterate, no one suffered illness who might have been treated. We have long surpassed the eutech gathered from Shipspire; yet we have grown carefully and cleanly. We have eluded pollution, eradicated plague, and chosen peace. No maltech weapon has been discharged in centuries. Our atomic weapons were dismantled before they could ever be used. We are our own triumph.&quot;\n\nShe has elected not to use graphics or theater. She would rather they remember her face.\n\n&quot;You know yourselves,&quot; she says. &quot;Let me tell you of your cosmos. We live in a spatially infinite, isotropic universe 12.1 billion years old. Its metallicity is ideal for life and for the spread of technological civilizations. In time, the distance between all points in the universe will contract to zero, and the cosmos will collapse into a singularity, to be reborn in fire. There will be no end to eternity here.&quot;\n\nShe pauses. She waits. The whole world is out there, begging for the answer to the question.\n\n&quot;Our world is a gift. And we must refuse it.&quot;\n\nThey are Awoken. They love secrets. They will wait for her to explain.\n\n&quot;We have detected a pattern that was imprinted into our universe by its ancestor: a fingerprint of the initial conditions into which existence was born. From this information, we have confirmed the most primordial of Awoken myths. Our universe is a subset of another. We live within a singularity, a knot in space-time, that orbits a star in another world.\n\n&quot;Conventional relativity would suggest that time outside an event horizon passes quickly compared to a clock within, but our universe has a peculiar relationship with its mother. Thousands of years have passed for us on the Distributary. Outside? Centuries, at most. We are a swift eddy in a slow river.\n\n&quot;These ideas may not surprise you after centuries of theorizing and philosophy. But we have decrypted new data from the cosmic microwave and neutrino background signals. We have discovered voices&hellip; the voices of distress calls. They tell a story of bravery, of war, and of desperate loss.\n\n&quot;We were not always immortal. We did not earn this utopia by covenant with any cosmic power, or by attaining an enlightened moral condition. We are refugees. We fled from an apocalyptic clash between our ancestors&#39; civilization and an invading power.&quot; She lowers her eyes. &quot;The signals we have retrieved tell us that our ancestors were on the edge of defeat. Perhaps extinction.&quot;\n\n&quot;It is time that we accept our debt. The Distributary is a refuge, not a birthright; a base to rebuild our strength, not a garden to tend. I ask you, Awoken, to join me in the hardest and most worthy task a people has ever faced. We must leave our heaven, return to the world of our ancestors, and take up the works they abandoned. If some of them survive, we must offer aid. If they have enemies, we must share our strength. We must go back to the war we fled and face our enemies there.&quot;\n\nShe lets them dangle a moment before she drives it home. &quot;We have also determined that our birthright, our immortality, is tied to the fundamental traits of this universe.

The old nets were slack, now. Needed to be rehung. No one came by who cared enough to restring them, and the Farm&#39;s current inhabitants were not the sporty type.\n\nBeyond the field were the rolling hills of the European Dead Zone, and on the horizon the twisted, ruined spur that was the Shard of the Traveler. Her first days back on her feet, recovering from the attack at the apartment, she&#39;d stared in wonder at that view.\n\nNow she watched the clouds idly roil and collect around the Shard, bored. Eva smiled, and shifted her weight off the wall and onto the carved cane that kept her upright. To think after everything that had happened, she could be bored.\n\nHer first days at the Farm had been a whirlwind of medical treatments, rushed through by attendants already on their way out as she was coming in. It had been the final days of the Red War, a major operation planned to retake the City.\n\nOne old woman coming in from the Underground was a low priority, and in the commotion even the old friends she&#39;d hoped to see had missed her.\n\nNow, she was alone. Or, mostly alone. She turned her head to see the Cryptarch, Tyra Karn, chattering away with Farm&#39;s postal frame. With primary operations returned to the City, Darbi had become Tyra&#39;s unofficial research assistant. Together they continued to study and examine Humanity&#39;s history through the lens of the Dead Zone, a sideline from the turmoil at the Tower Tyra was apparently only too happy to claim.\n\nThe scout, Devrim, came by every once in a while for a chat as well. When he was feeling cheeky, he referring to their little group as the &quot;old hands club,&quot; usually smirking over the top of a cup of tea.\n\nBoth still had official jobs to do, of course, and they took their roles very seriously.\n\nEva was at the Farm very unofficially. Her role at the Tower had never been one vital to operations, of course&hellip; but no one had rushed to ask her back to the market, either. Tess and Banshee had reached out once in a while, and she&#39;d given advice on how to set up their new space.\n\nBut Eva was here at the Farm for the lost.\n\nThey trailed into the place in ones and twos. They all shared something in common: the Shard hadn&#39;t connected with them. They came to sit and stare at it, off in the distance. To talk about how hard the Red War had been, as unpowered Guardians&mdash;some forced by circumstance to literally sit on the sidelines.\n\nWhen the Light had returned, some of them reported that it felt different. It sat under the skin like a suit that didn&#39;t quite fit anymore.\n\nA diminutive Exo woman was one of the pilgrims Eva remembered most clearly. She hadn&#39;t even known they made Exos that short. The woman shifted and twitched as she talked, unable to calm herself.\n\nAt the mention of the Light fitting differently, a statement she&#39;d heard a lot of Guardians make, Eva asked the same question she always did. &quot;So does that mean the Light is different now? Or are you?&quot;\n\nThe Exo stopped and narrowed her eyes, thinking. She was stock still for the first time since arriving at the Farm.\n\nThat was usually how it went. Sometimes asking the question was all it took to get them sorted out. Others took a lot longer, sometimes spending weeks at a time at the Farm just doing as Eva was: staring up at the Shard.\n\nSome&hellip; some came to the Farm, found no answers, and left on foot walking toward that great landmark on the horizon. So far as Eva knew, none of them had ever come back through the Farm.\n\nIt was a strange life. Another strange time, another role she&#39;d never asked for.

Efrideet&#39;s solar knife had divided his head.\n\n&quot;Hold!&quot; the Lady barked, firing her cannon into the ceiling as three Ghosts materialized above their charges. Bits of wood fell on her shoulder. Wu Ming cursed audibly this time.\n\n&quot;You know who I am,&quot; she shouted at the room. &quot;At this distance, I could shoot all of you out of the air swifter than you could ever bring your Risen back.&quot;\n\nThe Traveler&#39;s children froze, their shells spinning aggressively in the air like metallic bees.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re free to go,&quot; she told them. &quot;But your Risen stay with me.

The music helped.\n\n&quot;Is this why you asked me here?&quot; Efrideet said, holstering her weapon. &quot;You said you had some business that paid.&quot;\n\n&quot;I did. You just finished it,&quot; he responded, reaching out with a fistful of Glimmer.

Glimmer represented pure material potential.\n\n&quot;You didn&#39;t bring Felwinter,&quot; Wu said.\n\nShe eyed him. &quot;I told you he never comes down from the Peak unless it&#39;s official Iron Lord business.

He was shivering in his long coat, and if not for his Ghost, he would have succumbed to the cold long ago.

Thus, I asked my Queen, who has preached a doctrine of balance, if she truly believed in the equal worth of Light and Dark.\n\nThe Awoken were made in conflict, she reminded me. All her people volunteered to return from heaven to fight and die in the cosmic war. They are by nature and by doom drawn to that edge, that place of tension.

We must remember the value of unshakable, irrational hope. The choice to act as if we lived in a better world can create a place for that better world to exist.\n\nI do not think that a good Guardian can even for a moment entertain the Darkness.

They found themselves in the thick of the forest, with the wind wailing, a storm coming down, branches flying&hellip; and realized they had to stay put.\n\nSo, they find the wreckage of a dropship, lean up a wing and crumpled siding, and squeeze all the grown-ups and the two little ones into the dry space under the rusted hull.\n\nThen Amanda&#39;s mother says, &quot;We&#39;ll be here a while.

Although Ghaul&#39;s campaign made no real provision for continued resistance after the Traveler was contained and the Almighty moved into firing position, his opening gambit achieved a level of strategic surprise that would be the envy of any ancient general. Psion electronic warfare units compromised the City&#39;s sensor perimeters and suppressed our satellite early warning systems (so thoroughly that they even maintained their failsafe signals until the last possible moment). An extraordinary deception program in the Prison of Elders, combined with relativistic projectile strikes against key sensors, blinded the Reef to a simultaneous attack.\n\nBut how did the Red Legion escape the notice of the entire scattered Dead Orbit fleet? It would be politically unwise to suggest that the Arachs withheld information so their precious ships would be spared a losing battle... and indeed, the integrity of that same fleet proved invaluable in the counterattack and the city&#39;s reconstruction. It would be even more politically incendiary to suggest that the Future War Cult viewed the City&#39;s brief occupation as politically useful (or, more charitably, as a necessary step towards some desirable future timeline).\n\nBut it is impossible not to ask: how did the same Guardians who foresaw Oryx in prophecy (and in captured enemy material) fail to anticipate and take measures against the Red Legion attack? Is there something intrinsically more secular, and thus unforeseeable, about the Cabal? Do they practice superior information security to the Hive&mdash;unlikely, given the interception of a Cabal distress signal in the wake of the Taken War?\n\nDid some agency, henceforth unknown, act to conceal Ghaul&#39;s approach from our protectors? One that shared with Ghaul some central motive&mdash;whether the destruction of the Guardians, the capture of the Traveler, or the apprehension by force of the abilities we call the Light?\n\nIf such an agency exists, capable of such totality and subtlety in its action, how has it concealed itself from us?\n\n3. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say we had a leak. Hassan&#39;s a real ringer. Hope he gets rezzed as one of us when he dies.\n\n4.

The attack had been swift and brutal. Twenty dead. Only nine survivors, here, in this cave. I watched the tree line, anxious and afraid.\n\nThe mother&#39;s pain filled the space between the thick trees. I turned back to her and saw it for the first time: the child&#39;s spark.\n\nFaint. But there.\n\nThis little boy was not my charge. Those selected to return were champions. This child was so small, so frail. What devotion had he shown? What bravery? What had he sacrificed? But a thought lingered&hellip;\n\nWas it not my purest purpose to deliver hope? Every hero raised fought not for themselves but for the whole of humanity. If saving one life&mdash;if redressing this one terrible loss&mdash;was not a worthy cause&hellip; what was?\n\nI watched the mother as she cried.\n\nI felt myself expand. Felt the Light that was me intensify. In a way, it was outside of my control, as if something had reached inside of me and flipped a switch. A beam erupted from my core and bathed with Light the child&#39;s small, broken body.\n\nA second passed&mdash;\n\nAnd he began to cry. All fell silent. The Traveler&#39;s gift had been given. A child, returned. And with him, the beginning of my journey&#39;s end.\n\nDid I do the right thing? Would the child grow to reach his peak physical self? Would he, like all returned, be ready for the wars to come?\n\nBut then a thought came over me, one I had never before considered: maybe death would have been better.\n\nHad I saved the child, or doomed him?\n\nAs his cries echoed, the survivors looked on in shock. There was joy in their silence&mdash;wonder.\n\nI looked down on him, and pride began to well inside of me. I had done what was right.\n\nBut that was then&mdash;only months ago, but long enough to seem a lifetime.\n\nNow the Fallen are back, and we are running.

Fallen armed forces continue to fall back from active fronts across Terra. Factions of House Dusk remain active in the European Dead Zone. Throughout the rest of the globe, refugee attack incidents have dropped by more than 70% since the conclusion of the Red War&mdash;largely attributable to depressed Fallen and human populations rather than any significant change in interspecies relations.\n\n2. In absence of any united leadership, House Dusk continues to splinter and radicalize.\n\nThe recent trending emergence of so-called &quot;crime syndicates&quot; (cf. report #004-FALLEN-SIV) is emblematic of the continuing destructuralization of Fallen society. Likely an artifact of multi-generational colonization of human strongholds, this agent believes that because these syndicates have no relation to indigenous Fallen culture, young Fallen are appropriating and imitating human mythology in absence of a strong cultural heritage of their own.\n\nMuch like the dissolution of the Kell/Archon theology, this is positive news for those interested in the complete extirpation of invasive Fallen from the system.\n\n3. That being said, we should continue to monitor reunification efforts. Several personalities have emerged as potential leaders. First, the would-be integrationists:\n\nVIP #1121, well-known to Guardians of the inner system as Variks, or Variks the Loyal. Directly responsible for the release of the murderer Uldren Sov from the Prison of Elders, #1121 subsequently fled Awoken holdings in the Reef and now styles himself the Kell of Kells, still representing House Judgement. The Praxic Order has petitioned the Vanguard for permission to detain #1121. The Awoken monarchy, acting through the Queen&#39;s Wrath, has claimed jurisdiction over #1121 and further stated that any prosecution in absence of their involvement will be considered an act of war. The Vanguard has not yet made a statement about their position on the issue.\n\nVIP #3987, another former confederate of the Awoken, is a lesser-known personality known as Mithrax. Scattered field reports suggest that like #1121, #3987 styles himself a Kell of the so-called &quot;House Light,&quot; an otherwise unknown House apparently founded by #3987 himself. We have secondhand accounts that Mithrax has engaged in allied operations with Guardians in the field, though we have not as yet been able to corroborate these accounts with any degree of veracity. This agent is inclined to treat these reports with a healthy degree of skepticism until otherwise confirmed, as they may be propaganda from Fallen sympathizers in the Old Russian and Red War Guardian cohorts. We have requested intelligence records from the Awoken which may further clarify the matter.\n\nIn addition, whatever the findings of said intelligence records may be, it should be stressed that one or two sympathetic outliers cannot be relied upon to erase the wrongs of past centuries, nor should their good-faith efforts to correct the sins of their forebears be taken as sufficient symbolic reparation.\n\nSecond, the would-be separatists:\n\nVIP #4503, a recent personality known as Fikrul, or the Fanatic. A close confederate of the murderer Uldren Sov, #4503 has the apparent ability to raise himself from the dead in a manner not dissimilar to Ghost-aided resurrection. Though his reign on the Tangled Shore was limited, he possesses sufficient skill, hatred, and motive to warrant on-going surveillance. Given #4503&#39;s propensity for resurrection, the inherent risk of #4503 reclaiming the body of the murderer Uldren Sov from his final resting place in the Dreaming City goes without saying. The Vanguard continues to deploy fireteams to suppress #4503; our agents have reached out to the Cryptarchy and the Gensym Scribes to request guidance as to his permanent destruction.\n\nVIP #2029, a once-known personality known as Eramis, or Eramis, the Shipstealer. A House Devils Baroness incarcerated during the Wolf Wars, #2029 successfully fled the Prison of Elders during the mass escape orchestrated by #1121. #2029 is a classical Fallen pirate of the old ways: vicious, uncompromising, and possessing cunning of the highest degree. Field reports indicate that she is rallying violent dissidents to reconstruct House Devils from the ground up. This agent believes her to be the most viable candidate for universal Fallen reunification, and would urge the Vanguard and other interested leadership to aggressively prioritize her destruction.\n\nWe have come too far to pull our punches now.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29501": {"title": "9: Thin", "text": "Osiris burns; a roaring visage against the sky-soot firmament.

Or of Uldren, his Awoken &quot;father,&quot; who snatched him from the edge of death and awakened within him a power never before seen in the Eliksni. A power over death itself. A power to remake their people and thrive in a universe of Light and Dark that had both forsaken them and left them scorned.\n\nVariks knew these feelings all too well. It was here, in the deepest catacombs of the Prison of the Elders, where he thrived, where he worked to rebuild the Eliksni. This was his home now, this workspace where he was free to explore the &quot;potential&quot; of the prison&#39;s inmates for future leverage. The emerald marrow worm-food of the Hive, the prismatic viruses of the Vex, Psion Flayer wavelengths&mdash;each of these secrets had been wrested free within these dank halls, traded among his networks for more secrets, or harnessed into weapons for the Awoken.\n\nBut the secrets of Fikrul&#39;s&hellip; mutation&hellip; eluded him. The power within was obvious. Scattered about the floor was the evidence of its potency&mdash;as well as too many nights of failure: wrecked sentry Servitors, dozens of deflated Dregs, all pulled from the upper cellblocks to act as his &quot;assistants.&quot; Whatever this cold unnatural cocktail was that coursed through Fikrul, it could not be transferred or ingested like the Ether his people needed to sustain their wretched lives.\n\nVariks was all too ready to give up, send Fikrul into the arena to face Cayde-6, and put an end to the legacy of the Scorned Barons&mdash;until one day, during Variks&#39;s rounds, Uldren spoke to him unprompted. There was a lucidity in the discarded prince&#39;s eyes, a clarity that didn&#39;t exist even before he disappeared over Saturn&#39;s rings. Uldren gave Variks a&hellip; fresh perspective.\n\nAnd so, the chain. It was a dangerous gamble, mingling Fikrul&#39;s polluted lifeblood with traditional Ether. These Servitors held seventy percent of Variks&#39;s own Ether reserves. If this failed&hellip; well, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time Variks had risked everything and lost.\n\nVariks pulled the lever.\n\nThe hum of the Servitor chain crescendoed, but all he heard was the lingering echo of Uldren&#39;s poisonous question: Do you know where your true loyalty lies, Variks?\n\nBut if it worked&mdash;perhaps Fikrul could be cured. Perhaps&mdash;if what Variks suspected was true, and Fikrul&#39;s corruption was related to the Prince&#39;s affliction&mdash;Uldren could be cured, too.\n\nVariks had said as much to Petra, but she&#39;d refused to listen.\n\n&quot;You will not experiment on the Prince.&quot;\n\n&quot;Our Prince is ill.

It sounds to me like one of them is always happy, and the other is always sad. That&#39;s no way to live for either of them. These things must exist in balance. I know they&#39;re computers, but I worry for them.\n\nOne Guardian in particular spoke to me recently of the time he told the Failsafes about the Dawning festival. He had just turned some bounties in to them and mentioned that he was excited to get back to Earth to participate in the festivities. They stopped him and asked him to explain what that meant&mdash;they had never heard of the Dawning! He said something to the effect of, &quot;It&#39;s a winter celebration that combines several old Earth traditions.&quot;\n\nThey responded&mdash;I will try to word this exactly as he did, since he prided himself on his imitation of them&mdash;they responded by the happy one saying, &quot;According to my database, Earth&#39;s &#39;winter&#39; occurs when one hemisphere is oriented away from the sun! Why do you celebrate being cold?&quot; Then the sad one said, &quot;I mean, I can&#39;t feel cold, but it sounds awful.&quot;\n\nSo this Guardian said something like, &quot;It&#39;s more that we&#39;re celebrating each other,&quot; which I love, because that is how I&#39;ve always thought of it as well. We&#39;re all here together, eating sweets and being with each other.\n\nThe Failsafes asked a few more questions and then the happy one said, &quot;If we are celebrating each other, how can I participate in the Dawning? I am all alone. It is very depressing!&quot; The sad one said, &quot;I&#39;m not gonna celebrate the Fallen.&quot;\n\nMy Guardian friend thought quickly and said, &quot;You can wish every Guardian that comes out to Nessus a happy Dawning! Celebrate with us! We would love that.&quot;\n\nThat seemed to cheer both of them up a bit, so I&#39;m glad he thought to say it. Apparently, they practiced wishing him a happy Dawning for the better part of an hour, so I expect they&#39;re quite good at it now. Go visit them if you have a chance.

Joyously and constantly, they grew in quality. Those who do not die are as malleable and passionate as the young, as tempered and constant as the mature, and as wise and humble as the best of the old.\n\nBut as ever, the Awoken were troubled by death. It was easy to imagine a world older and harsher than the Distributary, a world crowded with competitors where the slow-changing and lushly alive Awoken would be helpless beside austere mayfly-quick breeders who adapted with every swift generation.\n\nWhy had the Awoken been spared mortality? Were they, as the Sanguine preached, rewarded for their bravery and fidelity in a past existence? Or were the Eccaleists right?

However, Queen Nguya Pin declared she was now an avowed Eccaleist and that the Queen would lead the quest to identify whatever debt the Awoken owed the cosmos. It was time to pursue a dream beloved to all Awoken: the conquest of space and the assessment of the true shape and age of their universe.\n\nThe ancient court of the Queen gave the Gensym Scribes a place to lay down their pride and act as equals. Soon the greatest engineers in the world assembled in the Queen&#39;s court, and whatever wealth or resources they required flowed freely. Great cataracts of men and women spilled around the palace screaming of ramjets and apoapses deep into the night, then awakening to pots of thick black coffee to mumble about metric tensors and cosmic microwave anisotropy.\n\nInto this feast of ideas came Sjur Eido, searching for the woman who had turned Queen Pin to Eccaleism. Sjur smoldered with an ancient fury, for another thing that the immortal may nurture is everlasting vendetta.\n\nSjur Eido deduced who among the Queen&#39;s court must be a disguised Mara Sov. She followed the hooded figure to her laboratory and watched Mara go to work soldering a makeshift bolometer to search for signs of primordial gravity waves. Sjur Eido&#39;s fury and grief whetted themselves against Mara&#39;s thoughtless grace and ancient beauty, until at last her heart unseamed itself and spilled its hot blood in a shout. &quot;Mara Sov!&quot; she cried, throwing down her maltech matter laser between them. &quot;I cannot live while you live, but I cannot bear to kill you. I challenge you to a duel to the agony. I will fight your most beloved companion to the death and leave you forever maimed or else die in the attempt.&quot;\n\nMara could not refuse this challenge.

It came hesitantly, fearing death, but nonetheless it came.\n\n&quot;Come, come,&quot; snapped Savath&ucirc;n. &quot;Listen as I reveal unto you my design. You are aware that gravity is the curvature of spacetime, and where gravity is powerful, time itself slows.&quot;\n\nThe Thrall indicated that it understood, more or less, for it was a singer of prayers and not well fed with the fruit of the knowledge of physics.\n\n&quot;Now I have tried to put an Ascendant in orbit of a black hole while its spawn gather the tribute of an eon. But the worm is not satisfied, for it sees the trick. What I must do is amplify the speed at which tribute is gathered. A pocket world where time passes quickly would do well. Or a world where time is a torus and infinite violence might be gathered. With such a murder battery, I could become a being of supreme insight.&quot;\n\nThe Thrall indicated it was confused, but not lost.\n\n&quot;With this tribute, I shall undertake a mighty work. A real humdinger of a scheme. I&#39;m going to refinance my entire existence. I&#39;m going to move from an existential economy based on the accumulation of violence to an existential economy based on the accumulation of secrets and the tribute of failing-to-understand-me. I shall name this tribute of failing-to-understand IMBARU, for it shall be as formless as the mist.&quot;\n\nThe Thrall held up its claws, as if to say, please slow down.\n\nNow spoke Savath&ucirc;n Scheme-mother, &quot;In the beginning, Yul said to me, &#39;Savath&ucirc;n, you may never abandon cunning. If you do, your worm shall devour you.&#39; Cunning is the use of thought to predict the function of a system. Therefore, wherever a being should attempt to understand me and fail&mdash;has my cunning not defeated theirs? Wherever a falsehood is repeated about me, have I not displayed cunning? I shall gather tribute from every false prediction, misguided theory, fearful rumor, and ominous supposition which derives from the thought of me. And in time, I shall pin my quiddity upon these rumors. I shall discorporate, so that I exist wherever my schemes and conspiracies also exist. And so I will be immortal, as long as anyone seeks to understand me and fails. Do you see?&quot;\n\nThe Thrall demurred, saying that it did not know much of metaphysics.\n\n&quot;Good,&quot; said Savath&ucirc;n. &quot;It&#39;s a law of the High Coven that one&#39;s sinister plan should be incomprehensible to a Thrall. Do you know why we&#39;ve come here? If I am to take my tribute from the keeping of secrets&hellip; where else are secrets better kept than beneath the event horizon? My brother ruled the flat space of infinity, but I prefer these tide-washed depths&hellip; and in time, I shall make them my dominion.&quot;\n\nUr the Ever-Hunger heard this and was pleased.\n\nVerse 154i:5&mdash;The Encrypted Verse\n\nDo you know that nothing in all the cosmos has read this verse?\n\nI encrypted it eons ago, and ever since, it has gone undeciphered. At the moment you laid eyes upon it, I captured the entwined quantum state of the verse, your mind, and your Ghost. Then I used Quria to transmit that state back in time to the moment of encryption. You are your own one-time pad. The key to the lock of understanding.\n\nWho am I?\n\nCall me Coyote. Call me mantis, serpent, Cagn, Anansi, call me Sri-cleans-his-brother&#39;s-stomach. Call me the grandmaster of semiosis, the jeweler&#39;s hammer which gilds the signal, a purposeful mob none of whose members know its purpose, the infinite regress of enigmas, a self-questioning answer, the word not spoken, black ice, cataract of mimes, the ache and fever of overthought while bedridden with illness, the intolerable thorn of frustrated inquisition, gray regret at the end of a fruitless day, the thing which is unlike your beloved but arbitrarily recalls your beloved to agonizing effect, architrave of the no-window, needle driven in flush with skin so that desperate fingers cannot pull it out, sweet petal, unmemorable, crystal death, the provably improvable.\n\nI know your people well, and so I know all your names for me. But what is your name? I am, of course, especially interested in you. You saw me in the stone laid on your plotting table, and in the shining eyes of the admiral at her dying helm. You hunted me between the lines of your texts. Wherever there was space to fit me in, there you found me. You created me and gave me a part of your thoughts, and in presenting those thoughts to others round the campfires and networks of your little world, you expanded that space.\n\nHere at the center, I lie to you the truth. You have everything you need to know it, but I will give you a clue, as the duelist gives warning before she draws.

Will you kill for real?&quot;\n\n&quot;As a Warlord, I did many things I&#39;m not proud of. Under the Iron Lords, I adhere to strict rules of engagement,&quot; Felwinter said.

A Lord called Dryden had brought food for the town&#39;s starving people, but in return, asked to use them as bait to bring a local Warlord into position for an ambush. This, Wu had learned, went against the code set out by Lord Radegast, the founder of the order. Dryden had broken the rule of involving Lightless individuals in Iron Lord business, because it was those people the Lords had unified to protect. The town had agreed, of course. What choice did it have? But the ambush had gone horribly wrong. The Warlord target had brought a whole fireteam to the fight. Eaton&#39;s erasure was utter and complete. Though Wu later learned that Dryden won the battle, he lost every Lord under his command, Ghosts and all, and he committed the additional sin of inflicting final deaths on the Warlords he defeated, in an act of bloodlust and rage. In the intervening years, Wu had learned that Dryden kept this under wraps, and that he and his Ghost were now among the most decorated of Lords, next to the likes of rising champions like Lord Saladin and Lady Efrideet themselves.\n\nFelwinter sat frozen in his chair. It was difficult to tell if he had registered any of what Wu Ming had said.\n\n&quot;How do I know you&#39;re not lying?&quot; the hollow voice asked finally.\n\n&quot;I have live recordings,&quot; Wu replied. His Ghost transmitted a data stream to Felwinter&#39;s Ghost, who nodded.\n\n&quot;Eaton. Who were those people to you?&quot;\n\n&quot;Nothing.

These messages read: &quot;Remove your forces from our planets and moons, or we will respond with deadly force.&quot;\n\nBut Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for these figureheads and their War Machine were not Death.\n\nThe Emperor Calus, in his wisdom and mercy, permitted his Shadow of Earth to sit down to negotiations with the Earth Vanguard. Although the Shadow of Earth spoke of the Emperor and his knowledge of the coming end, the Earth Vanguard were so attached to their worldly struggles that they could not hear. They declared war.\n\nThe Shadow of Earth rose with such a suppressed fury that neither the Emperor nor his Advisors had ever seen before. Shuddering with rage, the Shadow of Earth spake thus:\n\n&quot;Who do you think I am? Without me, you have only a dwindling army of ambivalent soldiers. I am the Young Wolf. I killed the Taken King.

Consider you and your people warned.&quot;\n\nAs a courtesy, the Vanguard of Earth were permitted to leave the Leviathan unharmed, and the Shadow of Earth gathered the Loyalist forces. After the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X, which held in it the secrets of one of the most advanced predators in the system, the Aphelion, which had the power to devastate whole worlds in the blink of an eye, the Shadow was able to use this lost knowledge to rebuild the Loyalist fleet stronger and more magnificent than ever.\n\nWith the renewed ships of the Loyalist Fleet, the Shadow of Earth led an attack on the War Machine&#39;s seat of power, the region of Hellas Basin on the planet Mars. The battle was much less a war than a single, unmatched attack that left the War Machine Rasputin in cinders.\n\nIt was at this time that the Vanguard of Earth surrendered and begged for mercy, a request which was denied by the Shadow of Earth.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29525": {"title": "The Sixth Seal, Part I", "text": "&quot;It&#39;s real,&quot; Mia van der Venne decides. &quot;We evacuate.

That some level of deceit was needed to further my goal of seeing Azzir&#39;s path to the end is... unfortunate. But necessary.\n\nThe stage set by the foul sport the Drifter has crafted has given many Guardians the confidence they need to see the shadows for what they are without losing their way or tainting their Light. This was Azzir&#39;s gravest mistake. He plunged freely into the abyss thinking his will alone could fend off the whispers and the corruption. But alone we all fall. Only together can we thrive in light... and dark.\n\nWhich leads to the other need addressed by Gambit&#39;s promise.

Others quickly forfeit their troubling ambitions when faced with the dire truth of the journey they&#39;d begun.\n\nIn the end, many Shadows have fallen.

One of my favorite letters came from someone who was a customer of mine but once: Lady Sloane, Stoneborn out on Titan, one of Saturn&#39;s moons.\n\n&quot;Dear Eva,\n\n&quot;Happy Dawning.\n\n&quot;First, thanks for the delivery; all the requisitions arrived in perfect condition, and you did a great job packaging up the chicken (more on that later). We tried decorating the railings outside our Command Center with the garlands, but the Fallen have been using the lights for target practice. I guess we&#39;ll be getting some more next year and prettying up the break room instead. A couple of the Dawning lanterns got whipped away in the wind, too&mdash;we&#39;re not known for our clement weather out here on the methane seas.\n\n&quot;Some Guardians who&#39;ve been helping me out on Titan mentioned that you like to hear about Dawning traditions outside the City, so here&#39;s how we celebrate on this moon we call home.\n\n&quot;This year, I let the crew off duty early, 1600 hours, and took a whole hour off myself so we could have ourselves a little Dawning soir&eacute;e in our Command Center.\n\n&quot;Siren&#39;s Watch has got quite a view of the waves and some floating platforms, so we pushed our break room tables together, end to end, and looked out at the horizon while we shared a communal feast. Seeing as the room is exposed to the elements (the glass view window broke long ago, but repairing it just hasn&#39;t been a priority), Del and Ari had to bundle up&mdash;and we had to weigh the tablecloth down with chunks of metal. I&#39;ve had worse setups.\n\n&quot;Eva, it was the best meal I&#39;ve had in ages. That chicken? Delicious. Every one of us got to try a piece. We cut our protein rations into fun shapes, and once we got your taffy warmed up enough to chew, it was heaven.\n\n&quot;We exchanged Dawning gifts as well. Somebody even cross-stitched me an &#39;inspirational quote&#39; to hang in my quarters (&#39;Where&#39;s my beacon?&#39;; it&#39;s an in-joke). Decent tools, Heavy ammo, thick socks&mdash;those are the kinds of gifts that change hands out here. Maybe that doesn&#39;t impress people accustomed to the Dawning in the Tower, but those presents have worth to us.\n\n&quot;When we joined hands afterward, whether for warmth or just conviviality, we got to talking in a way we never really had before. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever voluntarily shared stories about myself in my life! We talked about who we were before the Red War, where we came from, and even where we might want to go in the future.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s not easy here on this storm-tossed moon&mdash;one jolt and you&#39;re tumbling off a platform into eternity. Between the Fallen and the Hive and the elements, we&#39;re always just struggling to stay alive. But as we sat there chatting, we FELT alive.\n\n&quot;I guess I wrote all this just to say thank you, Eva, for reminding us to take a moment to appreciate and rejoice, no matter what. I find that inspiring.\n\n&quot;Sincerely,\n&quot;Sloane&quot;\n\nI have never left Earth, and Titan sounds like a&hellip; very interesting place. But reading how this holiday has brought people together in such faraway places, I feel all my efforts have been worth it.\n\nI hope to see Sloane again someday.\n\n---\n\nAlkane Drag&eacute;e Cookies:\nMix Chitin Powder and Bullet Spray, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29579": {"title": "Ghost Community Theater Presents", "text": "The Ghost Community Theater presents:\n\nORYX THE NIGHTMARE DADDY:\nOne Brave Ghost Versus the Death from Outer Space\n\nA four-and-a-half-act play\nWritten and directed by Didi, Ghost of Marcus Ren\n\nSTARRING:\nMarcus Ren............................................Hero&#39;s Ghost\nDidi the Ghost.....................................Guardian Hero\nEnoch Bast...........................................................Oryx\nPixie, Ghost of Ariadne Gris............................Ir Halak\nSweeperbot.....................................................Ir An&ucirc;k\nGhost, Ghost of Enoch Bast....Ghostly Shade of Crota\n\nSee the play that Commander Zavala calls, &quot;An insensitive and disrespectful travesty of a production, with truly abominable prop design&mdash;an insult to the art of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;.&quot;\n\nThe eponymous Ghost himself calls it: &quot;Is this supposed to be me?

To wear the Judgment sigil in the Tangled Shore would be to invite death. Even with the Spider&#39;s blessing to pass, he would have been picked clean and docked two times over.\n\nThe hedonistic sounds of Spider&#39;s Palace scraped against him. Shouts of victory and defeat reminded Variks of the worst of the Eliksni. His peoples&#39; inherent need for superiority reduced to gambling for trinkets and gems.\n\nVariks searched the crowd, hunched down low. Just another Vandal. In the corner, the unmistakable crowd that surrounded the Hunter Vanguard when he was outside the City.\n\nHe worked his way through the onlookers to take up position alongside Cayde. The Hunter noticed him, he was sure, but said nothing. Variks, for his part, was silent. Watched as he lost a few thousand Glimmer and a sidearm to one of Spider&#39;s bodyguards.\n\nCayde spun a knife in his right hand and sighed dramatically. &quot;If we&#39;re going to talk, you&#39;re going to buy me a drink.&quot;\n\nThey found a quiet place at the end of the room. Cayde settled back in the booth. Waiting.\n\n&quot;You do great service to Reef, yes?&quot; Variks worked hard to keep his very recognizable voice down. It would be a shame for his vocal synth to malfunction and blare out across the room now. &quot;Capture Barons. Criminals. For Awoken. For Petra.&quot;\n\nCayde took a belt and set the glass down on the table, empty. Something hard around his eyes. Amazing how expressive Exos could be. &quot;Get to the point, Variks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Fikrul. The last Scorned Baron. He lives.&quot;\n\nCayde&#39;s horn cut an arc through the air as he shook his head, twice, definitive. &quot;Trust me. He&#39;s dead. Put a hot one right through here.&quot; He poked Variks right in the center of his chest.\n\n&quot;Seen on Earth. I have knowledge. I have information. You know Eliksni have ways. Like Mithrax? Like Taniks?&quot; The warden realized his error as soon as the name was out of his mouth.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t you EVER mention the name Taniks around me, got it? Not unless you want to lose your last two real arms. We&#39;re done. Get. You&#39;re bad luck.&quot; The Hunter stood, made to leave. Variks reached out and grabbed the Vanguard by the arm with one of his mechanic hands.\n\n&quot;I am sorry. I spoke poorly. Please. Listen.&quot;\n\nCayde shrugged off the arm and stood, towering over the Fallen for once.\n\nVariks sat up straighter in the booth. &quot;Take me to Zavala.&quot; The Titan Vanguard&#39;s name was a punctuated, flowing stutter in his mouth. &quot;I have information. He will like what I say. You for bringing me to him.&quot;\n\nCayde blinked. &quot;You want me to take you to the City? No way, bug. Not in a million&hellip;&quot;\n\nWith a thud, Variks dropped the hand cannon he&#39;d been hiding in his cloak on the table: a dull brown, bristles out the top, Ethertech trigger and muzzle assembly.

Another blast nearby caused the other civilians in the room to whimper and moan with fear.\n\nThe Exo barked into the unit. &quot;We need Guardian support, corner of the 1400 block Anchor District! I have a large number of civilians here, and our position is being overwhelmed!&quot; They punctuated their transmission by leaning out and firing off another half dozen shots. The Cabal roared back in animal fury.\n\nIt wasn&#39;t more than two minutes before Eva heard it: the distinctive sound of a Sparrow, running full-out. She dared to gather herself into a half crouch and peer out of the building. She was watching just in time to see a pair of them, a Hunter and a Warlock, descend on the invaders like vengeful angels. These two were professionals, she could tell&mdash;no swagger to them. They were efficient and deadly, and the soldiers began to fall back.\n\nSomething happened. Eva couldn&#39;t see what it was, but both of the Guardians reeled. The Warlock dropped to one knee, like his strings had been cut. The Hunter shook her head and raised a hand in the air, a distinctive signal, calling for the Light&hellip; but nothing happened.\n\nThe Cabal, like they&#39;d been waiting for this moment, struck hard. The Hunter was bowled over by a charging Centurion and crushed underfoot. The Warlock didn&#39;t seem to ever really recover, and he fell to the ground, riddled by the weapon fire of a dozen soldiers.\n\nThe Exo was standing fully upright now, shocked, and even as Eva opened her mouth to tell them to get down, they fell&mdash;a sniper&#39;s target.\n\nOne of the men retched in the corner, horrified. Eva gave herself no time to think. She snatched the comm unit from the ground and pushed past the civilians to a far window. She used the reinforced case to smash out the glass and began hoisting children through once the largest shards were cleared of the frame. She was the last out of the building, and a few stray bullets plucked at the wall near her as she made her escape.\n\nThey didn&#39;t stop running until they were sure no one was following. She had no idea which district they were in, no clue even what the building used to be. Much of the orderly streets and well-tended boulevards she knew had become a maze of debris&mdash;the last safe City, a maze of collapsed and ruined structures.\n\nThe children were huddled up in a great pile as the older folk talked quietly among themselves. Everyone was crying, on and off, but they tried desperately to keep it quiet.\n\nA high-pitched chirp across the comm unit startled Eva, and she slammed her head back against the wall behind her. She hadn&#39;t even realized she still had it. She reached down and keyed the pad.\n\nA hushed voice said &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot;\n\nHer own voice low and shockingly gruff, she answered, &quot;This is Eva Levante. Is this Tozzi?&quot;\n\nA pause. &quot;Tozzi&#39;s dead. She wanted me to make sure someone got back to you, though.&quot; Another long pause.

Half the town came out to see them.\n\nOne of the men wore red armor that fit the description of the Warlord that Dryden and his Lords were waiting for.\n\nThey say that one Risen, reasonably armed, can annihilate an army. Two Risen, assuming adequate cover for Ghost support, can fight infinite armies indefinitely.\n\nSix Warlords dismounted their machines in a line at the center of town, weapons drawn. They dropped Judson on his knees in front of them. No restraints. He looked unhurt.\n\n&quot;Does anyone want to claim this runt?&quot; asked the Red Man.\n\n&quot;We will,&quot; Germaine said. People groaned. Yu tried to run to Judson, but her parents held her back.\n\n&quot;A question, first,&quot; said the Red Man. &quot;Where are the Iron Lords? We saw one of their Ghosts. One of these?&quot; He tapped the bladed carapace of his own drone companion as it floated past him, its eye fixed on the townspeople. &quot;They like to meddle. Maybe they helped you, brought you some food? It would explain how you survive out here in this wasteland. But I can guarantee you their motivations are not in your best interest.&quot; The Red Man paused, scanned the crowd as his Ghost orbited above him.\n\n&quot;The Iron Lords are trying to disrupt the established order. And we&#39;re here to liberate you from them. You&#39;re under our care, now. So. Where are they?&quot;\n\nGermaine shut his eyes a long moment. When no one else spoke, he decided he would. &quot;You&#39;re right. They were here. But they&#39;re long gone. We paid them for supplies and they moved on a week ago.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did they?&quot; The Red Man raised his hand cannon and shot Yu&#39;s father in the head. The entire crowd flinched and huddled together as the man fell backward. Yu&#39;s mother cried out in fury, but held her child tight.\n\n&quot;Hand to my heart,&quot; Germaine said, holding his breath as he waited for the hidden Iron Lords to make a move. The Red Man held his gun in the air, watching the townspeople intently. The other Warlords scanned the horizon, gleaming weapons at the ready.\n\nJudson took the pregnant pause as an opportunity to pull a Fallen shock blade from one of the Warlord machines. He gave a triumphant yell and decapitated the armored Risen closest to him. As the body fell, he jabbed the length of the blade through the Red Man&#39;s back. A third Warlord pulled the glaive out of Judson&#39;s hands and stabbed him in the side with a gauntlet blade, then hurled him backwards over the machines.\n\nAll hell broke loose around Germaine as the Iron Lords suddenly opened fire from their positions in the surrounding hills. The townspeople scattered as the fallen Warlords rose in scintillating pillars of Light, the weapons in their hands roaring to life and spitting tracers.\n\n**\n\nThe Ghost watched from high above the chaos. Over the ages, it had gotten very good at hiding. It had gotten very good at all the peculiar things its chosen had asked it to learn.\n\nDown below, gunfire and explosions of Light tore through the collection of huts and shacks. The townspeople fled for their lives in the midst of fire and otherworldly flame as the Iron Lords finally abandoned their sniper positions in the hills to close in on the Warlords at the town center.\n\nThrough it all, the Ghost saw one of the men emerge out of the discharge of an errant explosive device, cradling the body of a child. He moved to relative safety behind one of the shacks and knelt down, holding an ear to the child&#39;s face. She was trying to speak.\n\nOne of the armored riders in the town square raised a heavy machine gun in one hand and raked the length of Eaton with golden tracers. The Ghost lost visibility on the townspeople as the hail of machinegun fire filled its vantage point with a rolling cloud of dirt and dust.\n\nThe annihilating, sense-shattering explosions came soon after, and the Ghost increased its elevation.\n\nIt waited until long after the battle had died out, and the surviving Risen had all left, before lowering itself back to earth.

The Traveler does not speak to me in words, but in dreams. Dream language is cramped. The messages come from the Traveler, disintegrate on the way to me, and reform into something else.

We should determine which factions can continue to exist, and give them an official channel through which to air their grievances and pursue their needs.&quot;\n\n&quot;Which ideas are dangerous, Speaker?&quot; Osiris asks. He is watching me, steadily. &quot;And who decides that?&quot;\n\n&quot;This is not a fight,&quot; Saint-14 says. &quot;We have enough of those ahead of us.&quot;\n\n&quot;We will hear from each of the factions,&quot; I say, ignoring Osiris. Some decision is better than no decision. &quot;Give them the opportunity to plead their case, save for those who have resorted to outright violence.&quot;\n\n&quot;Well, then we&#39;ve got to get rid of Echelon South, for one,&quot; Tallulah lists, counting on her fingers. &quot;And those Binary Star idiots, too. Trinary? Binary? Whatever. Anyway, there are plenty of fingers pointed at this new group, too. Monarchy something.&quot;\n\n&quot;If anyone can prove the rumors, we exile their leaders,&quot; I say, holding up my hand. &quot;The factions that stay will argue their case. Of those that have a valuable viewpoint to bring to the governance of the City, we create a council.&quot;\n\n&quot;This sets a dangerous precedent, Speaker,&quot; Osiris says.

It is the hardest thing in the universe for the dust to make a loop at all, because, like a gust of wind or a river, it was only meant to move one way. For a mind to function, the end of one thought must alter the beginning of the next: so, like rivers, like wind, the Nine could not have minds until they could make loops.\n\nLavinia Garcia Umr Tawil comprehends the Nine.\n\nThey were already ancient when the first human beings named themselves.

Great arcs of outbound dust collapsed back to their sources to create circuits of shadow. The thickening and thinning of these circuits were the first thoughts of the Nine. They dwelt in massive indifference, unborn primordial gods. There was no force among them except gravity; no structure except the distribution of mass. Their hearts were in the cores of worlds, but their farthest streams faded out into the turn of the galaxy.\n\nThey were the fountains of Achlys, the night before chaos.\n\nBut life arose on the worlds at the heart of the Nine, tiny complicated motions of ecosystems and metabolisms and computations. That life left mass-shadows in the wind of the Nine, plucking at them like harp strings. From these trembles of structure the Nine learned to seed enormous resonating waves, thoughts vaster than worlds.\n\nSo the Nine awoke. And in time they understood that they were as fragile as they were mighty; for if the life that seeded their thoughts ever passed away, they too would vanish.\n\nThey had no eyes to catch light. They had no ears to hear. And yet they turned their wills upon the alien world of Matter, and strove to learn, for they knew they had to protect their hearts, or die.\n\nWith a horror of revelation so absolute that it would drive her mad if she still had sanity to lose, Lavinia understands where the Nine have always been. They are within everyone, every system, every living and moving thing.

Suddenly there is a sound like a single bone struck upon a metal plate, and in the dark interval between two firework detonations, the body loses all structure, falls loosely upon itself like a rag drifting in water, tumbles, then snaps suddenly flat and taut into a pane of leather and skin. Through that pane comes a long black needle and the skin around it dimples into the erratic spun-cancer topology of some gruesome four-dimensional waveform which no monist process could ever produce.\n\nOut of that needle, as if dispatched into the world through fatal injection, comes the emaciated magnificence of D&ucirc;l Incaru.\n\n&quot;I must yield truth to you,&quot; the Hive Wizard sings in a voice that would make the terms of an equation flee from each other and hide in the arrays of distant sets so that arithmetic itself would collapse. &quot;It is in the architecture of these spaces to reward the victor. There is no Quria here. There are no Vex, nor any conspiracy to un-Take that which was Taken by my uncle and which now serves my Queen. All of those lies were part of my throne world, which you have sought. Is my cyclical death not the very engine which brings you here, again and again, in hope of answers? Thus I do own the portion of your mind which you devote to truth&#39;s pursuit.&quot;\n\n&quot;Would you ask to know about my mother?&quot; The crested head twitches with alien emotion. The fungal shoulders roll beneath their armored plate. &quot;Is She the one you seek?

Of the right and singular fate which Medusa foresaw and to which all your principles and purposes will bring you? Shall I betray the truth, which you have earned, of my purpose in this endless city and of the new way to which her Hive will turn?&quot;\n\n&quot;So be it. You will know, though it shall doom you.&quot;\n\nVerse 154i:3&mdash;Her New Compact\n\nNow in ancient days, her brother Oryx spoke according to the plan Savath&ucirc;n had devised for him. Sayeth Oryx, &quot;The Worm within demands tribute. Now you shall kill what you can and take what killing you need to grow&mdash;or for your own purposes, if you dare&mdash;and tithe the rest to that which rules you. Thus, tribute will ascend the chain and the excess shall pool at the height, as unlike a river to an ocean.&quot;\n\nBut Savath&ucirc;n, desiring neither a chain nor a pool, set about devising a secret way to feed the worms of Her broods. Thus She would escape the trap.\n\nIn Her modest cunning, which She prefers not to be overstated so as to preserve her from the scorn of gossips, She gathered several of Her Ascendants, who were in danger of being consumed by their worms. Then she pushed them through a rupture into close orbit of a black hole.\n\nDeep in gravity&#39;s embrace, time passed slowly for them. &quot;See how their worms are satisfied,&quot; Savath&ucirc;n said, &quot;for their hunger grows sluggishly, but their servants continue to dispatch tribute at the ordinary rate.&quot;\n\nBut the worms sensed the deception, and increased their demands. Thus, the orbiting sacrifices were consumed, and their remnants fell into the event horizon from which not even the Hive might return.\n\nNow Savath&ucirc;n came into possession of the Vex Quria, whose creation she had secretly engineered. But she feared that Quria would still spy on her for inquisitive Oryx. So she led her portion of the Hive into a black hole, saying, &quot;Siblings, listen, we must part ways a while, so that we may grow different.&quot;\n\n&quot;Now we stake everything upon cunning,&quot; said she whose lies may alter truth. &quot;Slaughter each other so that I may reap tribute and devise for you a new compact which shall judge thy claim to existence.&quot;\n\nThis pleased Ur, the Ever-Hunger, whose epithet betrayed an interest in time and appetite. Ur admired Her cunning as She used tribute to teach Quria to use Hive magic as a computational oracle to solve unsolvable problems. One of these problems was the navigation and engineering of the singularity.\n\nThen Savathun went out from her throne world, unto the singularity, which she looked upon and understood. &quot;Upon this place, I shall assemble my design.

As you all know, an unknown sender delivered six messages to VIP #2014. These missives were sent via Glimmer, using a simple encryption scheme that even a 55-30 unit Frame could have easily cracked. #2014&#39;s Ghost took immediate notice of these messages and quietly forwarded them on to IKO-006, who then distributed them back to us. Cf. reports #167-173-VESTA-DC for full transcripts.\n\n2. In these messages, the sender briefly purports to be none other than one ERI-223, providing fanciful details regarding her origins as a human woman who grew up in an apparent settlement of Old Russia known as St. Petersburg. None of this account sat well with anyone who actually knows ERI-223&mdash;not simply because none of her close confederates had any firsthand knowledge or belief that she knew of her pre-Guardian origins, but also because she is still active in the field and has personally denied sending these messages. That being said, in accordance with our rigor for skeptical inquiry, this agent was dispatched in pursuit of hard evidence to the contrary.\n\n3. I submit to you now photographic and video evidence recovered from civilian family albums, historical archives, and extant Ghost recordings originally captured in the Last City. Behold, ERI-223: a child of the Last City, born to civilian parents in a mortal-Guardian integrated neighborhood. Behold, too, tiny VIP #1786&mdash;though he is almost more unbelievable than ERI-223, if you look at his smile.\n\nOf the photos, original digital files are unavailable, but radiocarbon dating clearly identifies the earliest prints as more than three hundred years old. This is consistent with the timestamps of footage provided by volunteer Ghosts who were present during the same period. As to whether the child we believe to be ERI-223 is indeed ERI-223, please see the second compressed folder attached to this report for full double-blind forensics.\n\n4. In regards to the other personality presented in the six messages: Having consulted with AI-COM/RSPN and AI-COM/XBLK, both have attested that they have no record of any so-called craftmind designated Medusa. This does not discount the possibility that such a craftmind may have existed, but in light of the fact that someone was impersonating our former colleague, it follows that someone may have credibly invented a craftmind as well. We will continue to scour our records for any evidence to the contrary.\n\n5. Like many of those reading, this agent has a strong recommendation about the identity of the sender, but it is beyond the scope of this report. Cf. reports #024-VESTA-DC, 025-VESTA-DC, #026-VESTA-DC, #086-VESTA-DC, #001-034-HIVE-SAV, and #001-005-HIVE-DUL.\n\n6. Given the importance of #2014&#39;s contributions to our defense efforts as well as the recent downfall of the Awoken prince, this agent is deeply troubled by the idea that a malicious entity might seek to sway or confuse #2014 through the context of trusted allies. #2014&#39;s Ghost made brief mention of some kind of waking hallucination in one of its messages.

Changes like the rise and fall and rise again of the Bray cult of personality. Like the new worlds the Traveler opens up to humanity.\n\nAnd changes like the woman who calls herself Crown Six.\n\nShe has the compact, endomorphic build of someone&#39;s mom, a shape that would be disarmingly ordinary if it were not rearmed by glowing eyes, empty sunken cheeks, a thickly armored jaw, and a bare scalp studded with needled sensors. The petrol stink of Titan&#39;s atmosphere washes off her, mingled with the clean astringent bite of air lock spray. Like all Exos, she was once a person&mdash;someone who gave up her flesh for the tenuous immortality of a war body. Mia, unfairly, thinks she looks like an angry mannequin.\n\n&quot;Welcome to New Pacific Arcology,&quot; Mia says.

It took me too long to penetrate Quria&#39;s simulation and get you free, and for that I ask your forgiveness.\n\n1. I understand what&#39;s happening here. Oryx Took the Ahamkara Riven, who then fell into Savath&ucirc;n&#39;s claws. She devised a scheme to use Riven as bait. By inviting Guardians into the Dreaming City, then focusing the will of a group of powerful Guardians upon Riven, she tricked you into making a wish&mdash;a desire to alter objective reality to conform with our subjective need to save the City. Riven fed on that wish in order to breach the Dreaming City&#39;s defenses and invite D&ucirc;l Incaru inside. D&ucirc;l Incaru and her Taken are simply scouring the city for Awoken secrets; you don&#39;t need to fret about any greater agenda. Remember that you face an agent of Savath&ucirc;n. It&#39;s to her advantage to make you see schemes and conspiracies everywhere you look.\n\n2. The three-week loop must be a failsafe measure to keep D&ucirc;l Incaru safe as she pursues her mission. In a sense, this entire city has been rendered deterministic; only paracausal Guardians have any free will here. (The Awoken here have been touched by greater powers, so they are aware of their preordination, but they cannot alter it.) I&#39;m certain that Quria is behind this loop; as a Taken Vex, it&#39;s capable of pathological subversions of reality. I&#39;ll continue working on a countermeasure.\n\n3. I&#39;ve been correlating information on the Ahamkara and the Hive worm parasites. Both display a peculiar ability to convert the host&#39;s intent into an ontomorphic, reality-altering effect. Both use similar language in their appeal to the host. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re the same species, however. The Hive worms spawn large numbers of young from relatively few adults, always display the same physical form, and live in communal groups. The Ahamkara are solitary, elusive, and seem to alter form to suit (or confuse) expectations. The shared syntax &quot;o ___ mine&quot; may be the key&mdash;it seems to be a shibboleth used to invoke an ontomorphic effect, placing the target in a cage of &quot;o&quot; (activational, specific, appealing, and naming) and &quot;mine&quot; (defining ownership and subordination). Ahamkara and worm may have evolved separately to exploit this effect, just as many species independently evolve eyes. This might place them in competition for the same ecological niche. I would expect a rivalry or antipathy between them.\n\n4. Don&#39;t be led astray by Quria&#39;s misinformation. You must continue to hold the Dreaming City as long as you can.

The Emperor rightly agreed and approved the excursion.\n\nWhat follows is an account of the reclamation of the Athenaeum World X:\n\nThe Shadows of Earth, of the Eliksni, and of the Awoken arrived on the ice planet that held Emperor Calus&#39;s Athenaeum World X, the name of which has been lost to time. This planet, being a repository for precious, ancient knowledge collected by the Emperor, was chosen for its hostile environment, which served as a built-in defense system for intruders and thieves.\n\nEn route to the planet&#39;s Inner Sanctum, where the athenaeum world&#39;s knowledge was kept, the Shadows were stalked by an undocumented species of indigenous wildlife, whose natural capabilities as a predator proved unexpectedly debilitating to the companion-soul of the Shadow of Earth. The Shadow, being symbiotically reliant on its companion-soul, was thus weakened and the trio was forced to bivouac in place beneath a great monolith as a storm fell upon them.\n\nThe creatures, who so far had lurked at the edges of the party&#39;s vision, crept closer under cover of the storm, which grew ever stronger, and executed a stealth attack. Thus began a bloody battle, wherein the three Shadows fought back half a dozen creatures with modest success, and wherein the Shadow of the Eliksni fell in combat. Said the Shadow of Earth of this sacrifice later: &quot;He knew the stakes of our mission, and gladly offered his life to help us complete it. This is a sacrifice we Shadows are willing to make.&quot;\n\nIt was then that the Shadows of Earth and of the Awoken were able to access the Inner Sanctum, revealing hundreds of years of lost knowledge, which was reclaimed for the great Emperor Calus and his Loyalists.+\n\n+The scribe employed at this future date shall include additional detail here when the lost secrets of this (and other) athenaeum worlds are recovered.

My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nWe have conquered the Clipse.\n\nAmong all the clients of Calus&#39;s reign, all those diverse species he encouraged to join and influence our great culture, the Clipse were one of his dearest favorites. When they greeted his return with missiles, it wounded him terribly. But Calus neither sulked nor raged nor signaled them in the dead of their night to woefully demand an explanation. This I credit to his mysterious new philosophy.\n\nInstead, he asked Valus Nohr to plan and execute the reconquest of the Clipse, using only the Leviathan and the troops aboard. Then he asked me to deliver an account of Clipse history since the coup.\n\nCalus was proud of his aid to the Clipse. They are&mdash;were&mdash;trapped in endless war with their alien-infested biosphere, which spawns horrors wherever it grows. Calus saw this war as a regrettable but unalterable fact, so instead of military support, he sought to enrich the Clipse with fine culture and high luxury. The Clipse were not pleased. After Ghaul&#39;s mutiny, the Dominus tried to secure their loyalty by sending a fleet group to &quot;win&quot; their ancient war.\n\nOf course, the legionaries discovered it was impossible to conquer the xenocidal ecosystem without destroying the planet itself. Their efforts only poisoned the Clipse, both world and people. After a century of botched climate engineering, toxic shock attacks, and &quot;clear and hold&quot; nonsense, Ghaul wrote off the tormented Clipse as &quot;no longer essential to the strategic security of the empire.&quot;\n\nI think the Clipse hoped they could win back Ghaul&#39;s favor by defying Calus. Perhaps they thought their world was unconquerable. Perhaps they were even right, in the end. Valus Nohr landed on their moon and military capital Kaga-Clipse with just six thousand troops. For eight weeks, the Clipse attacked her by ground and by orbit as their robotic interceptors swarmed the Leviathan. I was not part of the great metaconcert that helped protect us, but the might of gathered minds filled the carpets with static and gave me constant d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.\n\nWhen Nohr broke out of her bastion on her famous thunder run, calling down the Leviathan&#39;s missiles on the vital command posts she&#39;d identified, the Clipse defense crumbled. Their last desperate act was a commando strike at the Leviathan itself. The boarding craft slipped under our sensors, but the metaconcert felt the vengeful purpose aboard.\n\nCalus stopped us from firing. &quot;I welcome their attempt,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me see their spirit.&quot;\n\nI called to ask his intentions&mdash;I have not seen him face to face for longer than I can count. &quot;I&#39;m curating my followers, Match,&quot; he answered. &quot;Thinking about the shadows I&#39;ll cast.&quot;\n\nThe Clipse attack failed, of course, but there was a survivor&mdash;the one named Rull. Some think he earned a face-to-face meeting with Calus, though I doubt it was truly His Face. With Kaga-Clipse in our control, we could destroy the Clipse world at our leisure. Calus rewarded their surrender by giving Rull a gift: everything the Clipse needed to end their agonizing perpetual war.\n\nIt was a sheet of paper, the thick rough-edged sort that Calus makes out of cometary water and cotton from his personal garden (he says that he likes the smell). Rull signed it after two hours in a room with Calus. The Leviathan&#39;s factories shuddered into motion, forging luxurious self-contained arcologies, pocket worlds that could hold thousands in perpetual comfort.\n\nWhen Rull&#39;s chosen people were safe in the arcologies, the guns of Kaga-Clipse bombarded the Clipse homeworld into a global firestorm. The chosen survivors in the arcologies would inherit lives of plenty. The rest had the peace of ash. The eternal war was over.\n\nI prayed to the cup in the mirror for answers. But it was Calus who responded.\n\n&quot;Match.&quot; He spoke into my mind just as a Psion would. &quot;I told Rull the truth. Everything is going to end soon. We must accept that. What matters is the joy and companionship we can find before the final moment. Why let billions suffer for a future that will never come? Life with no dignity and no purpose except to go on living isn&#39;t life. It&#39;s a virus. It&#39;s a curse.

She carries in her knapsack an unopened letter from her brother, her mother&#39;s ashes, a selection of seeds and cuttings from her favorite neighborhood trees and plants, and some thirty thousand songs and short videos on a hand-me-down myoelectric augment.\n\nOn the ship&#39;s manifest, Nasya Sarwar is one of two dozen classless Scopares, trash collectors and composters and caretakers devoted to endlessly tidying the many surfaces and people within the Yang Liwei that cannot or do not clean themselves. She hopes through hard work and perseverance, she will prove herself worthy of one of the ship&#39;s remaining civilian cryopods, or&mdash;even better&mdash;a promotion to an Auturge position where she believes she&#39;ll find the freedom to devote her waking hours entirely to the loving care of the ship&#39;s hydroponics facilities.\n\nNasya is quadrilingual. Several of her fellow Scopares are not: born monolinguals who got lucky in international Exodus lotteries, just like she did. When they realize that she can speak to some of them, they do their best to befriend her. They share meals. They show her photos of the loved ones they left behind. They explain the function of the ship&#39;s many impossible machines. In turn, she does her best to teach them how to speak to the others. In this way, they are all a little less alone.\n\nShe is twenty-seven years old.\n\n2.\n\nOn the day she awakens in the Distributary, she names herself Nasan Ar. She carries in her hands a small silver jar. A dent has crushed its lid; it is impossible to open. She does not know its provenance, but she feels an inexplicable tugging of grief in her chest when she thinks about walking on without it.\n\nShe makes herself a home under the largest tree she can find. In the early days, it is little more than a lean-to and a campfire, but she shares it willingly with whoever passes by. Her guests help her transform the lean-to into a proper cottage with several guest beds. One cottage becomes two, then two is three, until three becomes a village.\n\nNasan loves her guests and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become mother or mayor. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press tight around her. She is shackled to the earth by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. She feels monstrous. Why doesn&#39;t she love this? Why doesn&#39;t she want to stay?\n\nOne clear night, amid the honey-heavy smell of spring flowers and recent rain, she takes her silver jar and goes out into the dripping dark.\n\n3.\n\nShe wanders. She tries on lives like she is trying on city-tailored fashions: for a few weeks, she is a Corsair. Then for a whole summer, she is a field hand. When she tires of that, she balances books for an atom merchant who trades in radioactive materials. Nothing holds her. Seeing her silver jar, one man suggests she may be a treasure hunter. The idea sends her deep into a subterranean cavern where she finds no treasure, but instead bioluminescent worms and a Paladin who calls herself Sjur Eido.\n\n&quot;If you&#39;re looking for a job,&quot; Sjur says, &quot;I should introduce you to my boss.&quot;\n\n4.\n\nOn the day Nasan finds her calling, the Diasyrm styles her a translator. It confuses her, because the Speech is the Speech. Variations have developed over time, but none are so distant from each other that two Awoken from around the world cannot speak to each other. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Nasan asks.\n\n&quot;Well,&quot; the Diasyrm says. &quot;I&#39;ve been watching since you arrived. People look to you when they&#39;re fighting, and you try to understand each side before you try to help. When you speak, you do it deftly, without condescension.&quot; She considers Nasan. &quot;It seems to me that you lend people grace when you help them explain themselves.&quot;\n\nA little candle of pride flickers in Nasan&#39;s throat. &quot;That&#39;s just mediation,&quot; she says, glancing away.\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t sell yourself short.

Instead, he found kin in the form of seven scorned. With them, he found purpose and power. As their legend grew, he found believers and new truth. His banishment was not penance, it was reward&mdash;for his convictions, for his courage.\n\nFikrul, the crazed fanatic. Fikrul, the heretic Archon who spoke against the very faith he once held dear. Scorned and forgotten&mdash;but only for so long.\n\nFikrul was a Dreg.\n\nBefore his banishment&mdash;before his clarity of purpose&mdash;Fikrul was a celebrated leader of Fallen faith and a savior to those who embraced his teaching.\n\nArchons had long been elevated in Fallen society, but their stature grew, and their role shifted following the Whirlwind. As desperation took hold and the last of the Fallen raced across the stars in search of salvation, their dependence on machines evolved into a deep-rooted need&mdash;their weapons to fight, their ships to fly, their Servitors to survive.\n\nThat need became worship. That worship became faith. And the Archons&mdash;those who oversaw the care and consecration of the Servitors&mdash;were looked upon to provide hope through their words, teachings, and interpretations of the machines&#39; wants, needs&hellip; desires.\n\nBut Fikrul saw another path&mdash;one that would later be mimicked and twisted by the techno-deviant Splicers in the Plaguelands of Earth while he and his explored their own darker interpretations of faith.\n\nFikrul is a Fanatic.\n\nScorned and abandoned.\n\nFikrul is all who strive to regain strength of self and purpose. He is a survivor. He is the outcast priest of the broken plains, and his sermon is death and all the glory that follows.\n\nIn Fikrul&#39;s eyes, and those of the outcasts who rallied to his philosophies, machines were not superior. They were not gods. They were tools. Instruments to be mastered and controlled and manipulated in service of Eliksni pride. None should grovel for Ether. None should have their honor bound to the whims of manufactured deities.\n\nBut the evolution of Fikrul&#39;s faith did not end there. If the machines&mdash;the very things that had regulated the whole of their existence&mdash;were tools, why not life itself? Why not death?\n\nThere are many tales of the time between Fikrul&#39;s fall and his rise again as spiritual leader of the Scorned Barons&mdash;his struggle to find strength as a battered Dreg, his journeys across the system to challenge his faith, his joining with the other outcasts who were scorned, and his eventual union with his &quot;father.&quot; The only thing that matters, however, when confronting the dangers of Fikrul is this: He is a creature of faith.\n\nHis faith is the antithesis of all who stand in the Light.

Seventeen to one? She&#39;ll try her luck.\n\nThey laugh about it later over weak tea and hardtack.\n\n15.\n\nWhen the Guard invites her to join them, they present her with a war hammer.

It is impossible not to: every other blue-skinned person she has ever seen has either been dead or a distant figure hurrying for a gleaming ship.\n\nThe young woman cringes away from her. &quot;The Sinaloan ruins.&quot;\n\n&quot;Are there other people there like you?&quot;\n\n&quot;No.&quot;\n\nHearing her question, one of her friends pulls her aside to point up at the sky. &quot;Your people are up there,&quot; he says. &quot;They live among the asteroids.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why aren&#39;t they here?&quot; she asks, but he has no answer.\n\n17.\n\nThe everyday rhythm of the Pilgrim Guard suits her for decades: eradicate Warlords and alien invaders; protect mortal civilians; guide homeless refugees to safety. Their numbers wax and wane over time, but they are forever the watchers-in-the-dark, the living-shield-that-shelters, the ladder-which-humanity-will-climb-toward-rebirth. Inspiring campfire speeches are an endless fact of life, and they buoy her until she begins to recognize the leitmotifs of self-sacrificing heroism.\n\nOrin loves her leaders and friends; she loves her little ramshackle community... but she never wished to become soldier or symbol. Whenever they gather in the evening for dinner, she feels claustrophobic anxiety press around her. She is shackled to the wilds by all these people that she loves, and she has no words to explain her own restlessness. Alone on night watch, she tells Gol that she feels monstrous.

Fear does not bless us.

He feared the others would notice and pulled a small square of cloth to dab away the perspiration. No one seemed to know he was coming.\n\nHe had yet to see Osiris, and none had spoken of the prophet beyond cryptic phrases or referencing texts he already knew. Vance faced back toward the haggard door that kept dust and sand from whisking into the Spire Chapel. He no longer felt sunlight casting through it as he had when he first sat down. Vance gripped the pew, preparing to leave.\n\nWhispers trickled from a passage at the front of the chapel like drips of condensation falling on echoing stone floors. The passage was small but twisted downward, deeper still than they already were. Vance could not see where it led, but from it, he heard measured steps and metallic chimes. A robed figure draped in symbology and smelling of fern emerged from the passage, flanked by two Guardians trimmed in gold. One carried the scent of warmth. The other, ozone and tang.\n\n&quot;You are all in attendance to hear of our findings: The next directive brought to us through the divination of Osiris&#39;s own hand.

Every day, they saw the Cabal&#39;s control tightening. Civilian groups or the odd Guardian tried make a break for it only to be brought down by a swarm of ships hungry for a kill. The streets were no safer, with patrols moving in tandem and tanks rumbling through district centers.\n\nYears of supporting the Guardians, of listening to their idle chatter, had filled Eva&#39;s head with details about these horrific invaders. She realized they were doing rigid block-by-block sweeps, unimaginative and plodding. Just as described at the Tower.\n\nTheir group hid and observed and moved only when the Cabal did. In that careful manner, they arrived at the far reaches of the City&mdash;parts long abandoned, where Humanity was just a shadow cast upon the walls.\n\nEva found herself in consultation every day, organizing foraging patrols back toward the center. Evenings were spent suggesting strategies for the upcoming days.\n\nAnd to her great satisfaction, she spent nights sitting with a needle and thread, trying to make sure the survivors would stay warm on the move.\n\nAs the three Guardians recovered (they lost the Titan on the way to the Gap), they started offering more guidance. At their suggestion, the survivors never stayed in the same place more than a day or two. They posted lookouts every night and turned on the comms unit only every other day to listen for broadcasts. For chance transmissions. For hope.\n\nEva was there in the room when the Guardians heard Zavala&#39;s voice&mdash;his short, terse statement played over and over. &quot;If there is any Light left in the system&hellip; we rally on Titan.&quot;\n\nShe shut the door so the other civilians wouldn&#39;t hear and listened as they had it out. The other Warlock, Tam, identified herself as Trinh&#39;s sister. They were adamant that they try&mdash;somehow&mdash;to get offworld and head for Titan. The Hunter, Ramos, was just as adamant they stay.\n\nTheir discussion wound down and came to a slow stop with all three Guardians looking at her. She held up her hands and said, &quot;I trust you all to do the right thing.&quot; They stayed. And quickly became integral to the success of their&hellip; operation.\n\nWhat had begun as simple survival became an organized effort to evacuate civilians from the Last City. Foraging parties inevitably came back with more people than they left. Scouting parties probed the edges of the City and found avenues of escape, places where the Cabal were lax in their patrols.\n\nEva found that the same skills she&#39;d used to plan holidays at the Tower were invaluable in organizing this underground movement. She cobbled together boards from old classrooms to create a schedule and wrote on the backs of old forms and newsletters to make &quot;delivery packages&quot; of civilians and the occasional Lightless Guardian.\n\nDay in, day out, this became her quiet routine. She faded into the background of the Underground: plan, move, sew, repeat. Even when contact was finally made with the Farm and getting survivors to the EDZ became the goal, Eva was always there making sure the trains ran on time.\n\nAfter some thought, she asked that her role not be spread around. She got word to people like Tess that she was alive, and that was enough for her. She had the chance to get out of the City dozens of times.\n\nBut every time she thought she&#39;d take that exit, go with that convoy, she stopped herself. Settled back.

He was sitting in the laundry room, a place with a black-and-white checkered tile floor, watching his crows tumble over and over in the dryer, black feathers flurrying, beaks clacking. A big old female Cabal sat in the tub to his left, scrubbing her back with a wire brush. A Vex Goblin with the face of Alis Li in its stomach stood behind the counter, selling detergent. &quot;Uldren,&quot; she said, &quot;you&#39;ve got a hole in you.&quot; The Cabal grunted in agreement.

Those who left went to scour the ruins for lost history and give some succor to their Human cousins who still clung to a hostile world. The Awoken came unto these Humans like nephilim, armed with lost weapons, forgotten industry and medicine. They were like omens of hope, for they were often taken to be starborn colonists returned to the hearth, which was not, after all, so far from truth. All who looked on them saw that the night sky contained more than lurking doom. They bred true with each other and sometimes hybridized with Humans, and in the course of centuries, many forgot the Distributary and even the Reef. However, there was always in their souls an itch, a vector pointing to a distant place in the Asteroid Belt, where their Queen still dwelt.\n\n&quot;They&#39;ve made a difference already,&quot; Sjur told Mara not long after the first Awoken made planetfall on Earth. &quot;They&#39;ll save so many lives just with the provision of medicine, pure water, and construction supplies that even if they all died by year&#39;s end, they would each yield ten or twenty Humans.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know,&quot; Mara said, with bitter pride. &quot;Let the people remember them as saints and paladins, and tell no one how many more they might&#39;ve saved if they had only kept the faith.&quot; For she knew the precious value of each Awoken life: She knew how many she would have to spend and mourned each soul wasted on a lesser purpose.\n\nOn the day the Fallen struck, Mara was proclaimed Queen. It happened swiftly, though after no little debate among the people, for everyone was afraid of a monarch who could speak to their thoughts. Yet they feared more to deny her power and sovereignty, for they had come between worlds in her name. To refuse her would be to refuse their choice.\n\n&quot;Awoken,&quot; she told them, &quot;for the first time in my life, I hesitated to reach for power, and now one in three of you are gone. I cannot deny what the cosmos has made of me any longer. I am your one and rightful Queen.&quot;\n\nShe knew she had been a fool to pretend to be a peer to the others. What was true of her brother was true of all Awoken. They needed secrets to marvel at, secrets that rhymed with the deep enigma of their souls. They could not follow what they fully understood.\n\nThere would be a formal coronation later, in a place not yet built. Out of respect for that unhappened coronation, Mara did not at first wear a crown; and later she claimed as her diadem the ring of event horizon that surrounds the observable universe.\n\n&quot;My Techeuns,&quot; she said, gathering Kelda Wadj and the other eutechs who&#39;d remained, &quot;will be given absolute authority to explore our new power, the Traveler&#39;s relics, and all associated domains. We are no longer in the realm of pure science. We require an order of mysteries and witches to tend to them.&quot;\n\nNot an hour later, a Fallen Ketch threw off its stealth and began a deceleration burn toward 4 Vesta. The four-armed predators had traced one of the Earthward ships back through all its erratic course changes and to the Reef. They came in search of the source of these blue ape-kin.\n\nA salvo of coherent-matter guns gutted the Ketch: blink-quick death for the mighty ship, ancient fury compressing matter into a relativistic pinhead. It was a waste of weapons that couldn&#39;t be recharged or reloaded, however, and the Baron in command had already scattered his skiffs like camouflaged seeds. The Fallen Raiders came down all over the Reef and cut their way inside. The Awoken, young to mortality, terrified of death, fled in fear.\n\nMara, Uldren, and Sjur Eido rallied as many as they could. Sjur fought in a powered combat shell, but Mara needed to be seen vulnerable, silver-haired and narrow-eyed, hurling herself at the enemy. She fought with pistol and dagger, and her brother moved like a wraith at her flank. Her people were ashamed of their timidity. No more were the Fallen scuttling alien predators: Now they were an indignity, an offense to regal privilege to be met with a snarl and a rifle shot. The Awoken saw their desperation: how the stump-limbed Dregs stumbled forward emaciated, how the Vandals cringed from battle as they peeled off wall panels, desperate for salvage to please their Captains.\n\nArmored Sjur Eido met the Fallen Baron in zero-gravity combat above his spider tank and shot him dead, one adamant shaft through plate and throat. Ether hissed into vacuum. Sjur threw herself upon the spider tank that clung to the Sacred Fire&#39;s hull. Laughing in joy, she cut into the tank&#39;s barrel and threw a charge inside, knowing its next vengeful shot would be meant for the Sacred Fire&#39;s main habitat drum&mdash;and that she would die in the catastrophic misfire.\n\nThe tank fired. The charge detonated.

It went poorly, however, for though her tech witches were able to amplify her bond to her people through the augments Kelda had developed, she was only one voice in a maelstrom. Her Awoken had sensitive antennae, in the metaphysical sense, and could not hear her plea through the clamor. Also, the communications engineer kept forgetting to call Mara &quot;Majesty&quot; or &quot;Queen.&quot;\n\n&quot;Good news,&quot; Uldren told her with the grim delight he always showed after a debacle he had survived. &quot;Illyn and I went through the Fallen communications logs. Their Baron never transmitted our position to his Kell. He wanted the prize to himself. We remain secure.&quot;\n\n&quot;The Baron might have planted a time-delayed beacon,&quot; Mara warned him. &quot;Never underestimate these beings. They&#39;ve lived in the void longer than us.&quot;\n\n&quot;I already admire them,&quot; Uldren confessed. &quot;They&#39;ve lost so much. Some of them even ritually dismember themselves, Mara, to prove they have the strength to grow back the missing limbs. I tell you that even if we are doomed to dwindle and go extinct, those Fallen may outlive us.&quot;\n\nMara made a dry note in her log that her brother had at last discovered his true people.\n\nFor her part, Sjur Eido wandered about in a daze, filled with joy to be alive and grief that she no longer knew the day when she would die. &quot;In you, all things are possible,&quot; she told Mara. &quot;I live because of you.&quot; When Mara saw her string her mighty bow, the limbs coiled behind her leg and around her opposite arm, she was glad beyond telling that Sjur had survived.\n\nIn time, Mara appointed Paladins to oversee her new military, as Alis Li had done during the Theodicy War. She created talented starfarers as Corsairs, to scour the asteroid belt in utmost secrecy and to establish routes and caches that would support the covert motion of Awoken ships.\n\nMost of all, she charged her brother with the mission that occupied her thoughts. &quot;Brother,&quot; she said, &quot;never again can I allow my people to be divided.

As he speaks, Orin looks around. They are surrounded by a young forest vivacious with birds and clouds of gnats. It is impossible to imagine that a deadly alien might be lurking somewhere nearby. But Gol found her. Gol knows more about the world than she does. She trusts him.\n\nShe scavenges the leaf litter until she finds a fallen tree limb. &quot;Will this help?&quot; she asks him, testing its heft.

Less than thirty-six hours ago, I suppose.&quot;\n\n&quot;I should have walked faster,&quot; she mutters, and then bends over to be sick.\n\n&quot;You can&#39;t do that here,&quot; Gol interrupts anxiously. &quot;Stop, Orin. Stop. You have radiation poisoning. If you&#39;re sick here, you&#39;ll die here, and then I&#39;ll have to resurrect you here, and you&#39;ll be sick and die again and again. You have to move. Come.

This time, when he speaks, I can hear his hope, even through the mask: &quot;Why did the Great Machine leave us?&quot;\n\nI stare back at him.\n\nAny fear I felt before dissipates. Instead, what I feel is a grief partially forgotten in the chaos of trying to survive&mdash;and a deep and abiding kinship with the enemies who have pursued us.\n\nMy voice is very quiet when I finally speak.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;\n\nThe other two Dregs look at their friend, waiting.

A Hunter, cloaked in light gray and clutching Drang, pressed one hand to a bullet wound in his gut and slumped into cover. He winced as his Ghost spun Light into the wound, slowly weaving flesh together and extracting the bullet. He checked the remaining ammunition in his sidearm. Two hostile Guardians stalked his position in pincer formation and pinned him with suppressing fire.\n\n&quot;Blood money runs cheap these days,&quot; Vance continued. He shifted toward the frame next to him. &quot;Don&#39;t you think, Cheska?&quot;\n\n&quot;Perhaps the presented motive is flawed.&quot; Ch3-5ka, a repurposed Redjack and assistant to Vance, had expressed hesitation about their endeavor. It had expressed hesitation about using its uplink to patch into the Crucible monitoring system. It had expressed hesitation about the strangely coded sub-routine running in the Lighthouse spire&#39;s architecture. Some level of anxiety, Vance would jab, was intrinsic to Redjack programming.\n\n&quot;In the Crucible, Lord Shaxx guides new Lights with positivity and&mdash;&quot;\n\nVance nodded for a moment before interrupting. &quot;Most Guardians care only for power and glory. That is what makes Osiris so unique. Meaning drives us. Understanding. Knowledge. These are the marks of our work&#39;s importance.&quot;\n\nGunshots rang through the arena&#39;s capture devices. Ch3-5ka&#39;s commentary singled in on the Hunter, last remaining of his fireteam. The Hunter twirled from their cover, propelled by a burst of Light, and flicked a tripmine grenade under the assailant on his left. The explosion killed her instantly, allowing the Hunter to shift and rattle off three rounds, Vance noted, toward his other opponent. One round struck the Guardian&#39;s helm and ricocheted off, splitting his visor.\n\nThe Hunter squeezed the trigger again, which responded with an ineffectual click. The split-helm Guardian rushed him.\n\nThe sandy Lighthouse alcove they had repurposed as observation room was abuzz with Ch3-5ka&#39;s match analysis and an inconspicuous droning.\n\nThe Hunter dropped his sidearm and reached for a slung fusion rifle, but the rushing Guardian struck him solidly with a fist full of lightning. The droning hum shifted somewhat lower.\n\nVance straightened against his chair back at the frame&#39;s vibrant description of Guardians spinning deeper into ruthlessness. He could feel a crescendo hanging just moments ahead. He noted the resonant murmur undulating through his skin and into his bones.\n\nDowned and stunned, the Hunter struggled to stand. The split-helm Guardian towered above him, pulled a hand cannon, and slowly discharged. Every. Single. Chamber.\n\nThe hum spiked. &quot;Fireteam eliminated,&quot; Ch3-5ka stated blankly, though Vance could barely hear its words.\n\nThe victor stood over the Hunter&#39;s bullet-ridden corpse, and the Lighthouse sang to Vance. The Hunter&#39;s Ghost compiled into existence over his Guardian&#39;s body.\n\n&quot;Someone needs an attitude adjustment,&quot; the Ghost sneered.\n\nThe victorious Guardian craned his head toward the Ghost. He raised his hand cannon and sunk trigger to frame. The revolver&#39;s cylinder rotated, the hammer fell, and the piece gave off a heavy, empty click.\n\n&quot;Are you crazy?!&quot;\n\n&quot;Brother Vance. I believe a Ghost is in danger. It is against Sanction-C2-1 to harm a Lightbearer&#39;s Ghost.&quot;\n\nVance tuned the frame out, turning his ear instead to various audio playbacks from the match. He listened to distinguish gun caliber, Light affinity, and fireteam movements as the hum&#39;s tone changed. He traced them through sound cues and shouted, disembodied announcements. He pinpointed each variable for which he could account and directed Ch3-5ka to capture every analytic scrap.\n\nThe Guardian dropped a round into the cylinder and spun it lazily.\n\n&quot;Let&#39;s find out.&quot;\n\nThe Hunter&#39;s Ghost discharged a pulse of Light, blinding the Guardian and raising the Hunter. The risen Hunter swift-drew a cannon of Light, as if reactively defending his Ghost. He cracked off a single golden shot from his flame-licked weapon. The shot pierced its target and sent ash snaking into the air.\n\nThe Lighthouse played Vance a new song. It hummed, deeper than before. He took in the sensation as low bass rolled through his chest. The hums grew dull, darker, as if born from death. Vance sat straight up, spine rigid, with a wide smile on his face. He composed a harmony of similar tones in his mind, tracking their down-pitch trajectory with anticipation. He thought of Osiris, how his research had led him down less-traveled routes through less-practiced methods. The knowledge that Vance alone could interpret these tones focused his work and narrowed his inhibitions. Purpose persuades.\n\n&quot;Cheater,&quot; Ch3-5ka blurted out. &quot;Match-call misalignment.&quot;\n\nVance&#39;s response ducked the conversation to start his own.\n\n&quot;I heard the Light bend. The Lighthouse reached out to that Guardian when they died&hellip; and their Light reached back. They are harmonious.&quot;\n\nCh3-5ka picked up his line of thought, adding: &quot;Anomaly detected. There has been a transmission from the Lighthouse. Uplink time: 0.00019 seconds.&quot;\n\n&quot;A random artifact, nothing more. Conclude this match. Archive the recordings. There is much to do.&quot;\n\n&quot;Match-call misalignment.&quot;\n\n&quot;Of course. We cannot abide cheating. Give the match to the team with the incinerated one.&quot;\n\n&quot;If you believe that to be best.&quot;\n\nVance tilted his head at Ch3-5ka&#39;s biting tone. It was sharp, unlike the lathering hum of the Lighthouse, unlike peaceful static from the structure&#39;s sub-routine channels. The frame was starting to sound like Leanna.

Live-fire training exercises continue at the active incursion site on the Leviathan. No further RAID class operations have been documented since the unauthorized intervention against VIP #4044 at the explicit invitation of VIP #3801. This agent still believes that the Vanguard should institute stronger measures to prevent rogue teams from carelessly rushing to the aid of enemy VIPs &ndash; particularly given #3801&#39;s documented history of solicitous behavior and the tendency of our warriors to rush slack-jawed toward free gifts. #4044 could have been a useful catspaw in the destruction of #3801.

Despite #3801&#39;s recent inactivity, sentiment polls captured in the Tower at regular intervals over the last several months indicate that he has successfully swayed a significant percentage of the Red War cohort to believe that he may be a potential ally. Given our history with the Cabal as well as the events of the Red War itself, this is shocking and perhaps attributable to a case of mass traumatic bonding.\n\nIt is my strong recommendation that the Vanguard pursue a reeducation curriculum before #3801 invites any Guardians of the City to defect to his service, a possibility which we have documented in multiple previous reports.\n\n3.

The protein weighs only as much as 47,000 protons, not 53,000. If you were a cell, you would think p53 was a mistake too. It has several coercive functions: To delay the cell&#39;s growth. To sterilize the cell when it is old. And to force the cell into self-destruction if it becomes too independent.\n\nWould you tolerate a bomb in your body, waiting to detonate if you deviated from the needs of society?\n\nHowever, without p53 as an enforcer, the body&#39;s utopian surplus of energy becomes a paradise for cancer.

It is the alignment of individual incentives with the global needs of the structure.\n\nPatterns will participate in a structure only if participation benefits their ability to go on existing. The more successful the structure grows, the more temptation accrues to cheat. And the greater the advantage the cheaters gain over their honest neighbors. And the greater the ability they develop to capture the very laws that should prevent their selfishness.

All worlds, no matter their natural or synthetic geographies or climate, grew cold. The people of these worlds, having been subjected to this strangeness and adversity, began to grow afraid and suspicious of one another. Many deaths occurred in this intervening time before the end.\n\nNext, a great war broke out across all varieties of civilization, be they naturally war-minded or peaceful. This warring, which goes on even now, is due to a futile desire to postpone the end of things when no such deferment can possibly occur; as such, the civilizations of the Sol system do not partake, for they accept the coming end as shown to them by their beloved Emperor. Even so, these good creatures are not exempt from the miserable clawing of others, who thrash blindly against the inevitable end.\n\nBut, we know from the words of the Great Emperor, the suffering will end. Death will soon arrive to the universe, and claim all of it for Itself. This will be the end of everything: all living things and non-living things, all that is real or theoretical.\n\nThe last to see it, to see Death as It consumes everything in this world, will be the great Emperor himself.\n\n+The scribe employed at this future date shall adjust the name mentioned here, should I, Scribe Ixolt, expire before the publication of this record.

I watch the ships coming in, and the birds, and the clouds&mdash;I get so busy that it helps to step away for a little while and remind myself of what&#39;s outside. The other day, I was sitting on this bench when a very tall Titan stepped up beside me, his hands folded in front of him.\n\n&quot;Excuse me, ma&#39;am,&quot; he said. &quot;Would you mind if I sit here?&quot;\n\nI smiled and shifted over to make room. &quot;Please,&quot; I said. He sat. His shoulders were so broad that I had to shift over a little more.\n\nHe had a bag of birdseed with him, and I watched as he spread a little of it on the ground. The pigeons came quickly&mdash;in fact, I&#39;d noticed a few more than usual the instant he sat down. I wondered to myself how often he came here and how we&#39;d managed to miss each other thus far. He was not an easy man to miss.\n\nThe cooing of the pigeons and the far-off bustle of the City were soothing, and seeing as the gentleman seemed to have no trouble with companionable silence, I closed my eyes. After a moment, though, I was aware of footsteps and whispering behind us. A young woman, another Titan, came up to the bench and said to the gentleman, smiling nervously, &quot;It&#39;s such an honor to meet you. You&#39;re an inspiration to Titans everywhere.&quot;\n\nHe nodded humbly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said. They spoke briefly. He asked her name. They talked about how she&#39;d just come back from being stationed on Io for patrol duty. He commended her commitment to keeping the people of the system safe, and then she and her friends left.\n\nMy companion went back to feeding the pigeons. After a moment, I asked him, mostly joking, &quot;Are you famous?&quot;\n\nHe glanced at me and inclined his head, hesitantly. &quot;A little bit.&quot;\n\n&quot;I see,&quot; I said, smiling. After a moment, I added, &quot;My name is Eva.&quot;\n\n&quot;Saint.&quot;\n\nI sat with that answer for a moment and then asked, &quot;Saint-14?&quot; I&#39;d heard the story of how he fought for the City during the Battle of Six Fronts, so long ago, and another more fantastical story about how he&#39;d defeated a powerful Fallen fellow by headbutting him. Anytime I heard that story, I always found myself hoping he had a good, sturdy helmet.\n\n&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; he said, spreading a little more birdseed. &quot;It is a pleasure to meet you, Eva.&quot;\n\nWe sat a little longer together, watching the pigeons and the clouds, before I finally had to excuse myself to go back to my work.\n\nAs I said, I&#39;d heard the legend of Saint-14 before. Many legends of remarkable Guardians make them seem like mythical figures, so far removed from anything the civilians of the City will ever see or experience. The legendary Saint-14 does not seem that way to me at all.\n\nIn fact, I think he is a very nice young man.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29750": {"title": "Building", "text": "You are the last remaining star.\n\nIn your dreams, you see yourself suspended in bright but flickering Light, staring out over a world half-destroyed.

There are about three hundred of us, and we&#39;ve lived here for nearly seven years. When we first arrived, we were under the jurisdiction of a Warlord named Cathal. He offered us protection for a high price, requisitioning a third of our supplies and conscripting nearly half our people to his cause. The actual protection he provided was limited. The Warlords used our valley like a battlefield, crashing through like giants who couldn&#39;t see the lives they were ending. But they could. They saw us. They just didn&#39;t care.\n\nThe Iron Lords drove Cathal out nearly a year ago, and we&#39;ve lived in comfortable independence since then, with little oversight from our Risen saviors. Our people voted for that. The Iron Lords saved us, but they would be no different from the Warlords if they also wished to rule us.\n\nNow I sit in negotiations with one of them, a woman named Lady Efrideet.\n\n&quot;You&#39;re free to decide either way,&quot; she says. &quot;But if you say yes, you&#39;ll have an armed escort.&quot;\n\nThree other people sit with me: our elected mayor, our most experienced physician, and our oldest resident. We are the people our settlement chose as representation. Beside me, a silver Ghost spins his shell, floating at my shoulder, watching Efrideet. He&#39;s followed me for over a year now, and still hasn&#39;t found his chosen. He&#39;s good company.\n\n|| I have given so much of myself already, but I give more. I become a beacon. I call my children home. ||\n\n&quot;A consolidated population like that, all in one place,&quot; our mayor says. She sounds weary. She&#39;s been in her position for nearly sixty years. &quot;It would draw Warlords to us like flies.&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t worry about the Warlords,&quot; Efrideet says, with the cool assurance of someone who only half-understands our worry to begin with. &quot;Their days are numbered. Their way of life is incompatible with the Iron Decree, and so&hellip;&quot; She shrugs.\n\nHer nonchalance is unrelatable, but I think I trust her. I trust the Iron Lords. They&#39;ve given us little reason to doubt them.\n\n&quot;How would the city be governed?&quot; I ask.\n\nEfrideet shrugs again. &quot;That seems like the kind of thing you put to a vote.&quot; She taps her fingers on the table, impatient, but only a little. &quot;We&#39;ll just build the place and bring people there. We can defend the walls, but we&#39;re not going to dictate what happens inside them. This is a joint venture. A collaboration.&quot;\n\nMy companions exchange looks, considering.\n\nEfrideet watches us. Like most of the Risen, she tries to look impassive. Unaffected. But if you listen closely, she&#39;s trying to convince us. She wants this. &quot;Listen,&quot; she says. &quot;Risen and non-Risen have lived in their separate corners for too long. We&#39;re all people. That&#39;s all the Iron Lords are trying to say. We should live together.&quot; She pauses. &quot;There are things we can teach each other.&quot;\n\nTwo weeks later, once we&#39;ve packed up everything we can carry, we leave for the place where we&#39;ll build the Last Safe City of Earth.\n\n|| I wish for something to grow in my shadow. ||", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29751": {"title": "Regarding Zydron, Gate Lord", "text": "My Queen,\n\nI find myself unexpectedly empathizing with the Vex Gate Lords.

To the south are the dry lands where the birds of the forest, especially the parrots, go to die. She lives here because one day she will no longer be immortal, and she wants to observe the dignity of death.\n\nUp these hills comes a man and his mother. The man moves with practiced wariness. But his mother is tired of walking, so she sits down on a giant melon and bellows, &quot;MARAAA!&quot;\n\nA fountain of startled birds shoots up into the dawnlight. Not far away, the woman looks up from the broken body of a juvenile gray parrot and softly says, &quot;Mom?&quot;\n\nThat night over the fire, after Mara and Osana talk around the oddness of long separation, Mara, tending the pheasants on their spits, says, &quot;Brother, your eagle killed a parrot today.&quot;\n\n&quot;He had to hunt,&quot; Uldren says, carefully. &quot;You won&#39;t forbid him his last pleasures, will you?&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve brought him here to die?&quot; Mara wants to leap up and hug her brother, out of pity and respect. Many of his raptors have died before this one, but Uldren has always been grief-stricken and furious at the waste. Now he&#39;s accepted what must happen; he has given his bird the respect of choosing its own place and time to pass.\n\n&quot;I have,&quot; Uldren says, looking away. Her pride and respect make him a little verklempt. &quot;Mother decided she would come along.&quot;\n\nA shear force as powerful as tectonics has divided Mara&#39;s heart. She wants to sit down with her mother and ask her everything, but she is afraid of Osana&#39;s insight. &quot;What brings you to my little camp, Mother?&quot;\n\n&quot;Lies,&quot; Osana says. &quot;Lies and secrets. And the girl who didn&#39;t want to be my daughter, who doesn&#39;t know the difference between them.&quot;\n\n&quot;I know the difference between a girl and a daughter,&quot; Mara says, purposefully misunderstanding. The drip pan sizzles beneath golden meat. Her stomach growls. &quot;Your daughter picks up your baton at the end of the race, and goes on living the life you&#39;ve taught her. You wouldn&#39;t want that, Mother. Because then I&#39;d be all your fault.&quot;\n\n&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Osana sighs, &quot;but you know what I meant.&quot;\n\nUldren looks between the two of them, frowning. &quot;Mom, what&#39;s this?&quot;\n\n&quot;It&#39;s your sister about to admit she&#39;s behind it all. Aren&#39;t you, Mara?&quot;\n\nShe unimpales the pheasants from the spits and neatly licks hot grease off her hands. If she spoke, she might scream in terror. What does that mean, behind it all? Does Osana know?\n\n&quot;The Eccaleists are her creation,&quot; her mother tells her brother. &quot;The Diasyrm was her pawn. She allowed the Theodisy War because she was afraid we&#39;d be too comfortable here&mdash;also so Queen Alis would need her help politically.

He knows Mara never answers his questions directly; by evading Osana&#39;s, it&#39;s as if she&#39;s saying that the question is really Uldren&#39;s to ask. &quot;Looks delicious. But Mother does make me curious. Why have you always lived away from the rest of us, Mara? The mountaintop, I understood. You had a brand new night sky to chart. But why now? Why go into the woods like a&hellip; a hermit? A heretic?&quot;\n\nFor the same reason she lived on the hull. For the same reason she can never allow Uldren to really reach her. There is power in remove and safety from the belittling politics of temporal power, which reveal the mighty as unforgivably ordinary and petty. The Awoken have a Queen because a Queen can be a mystery.\n\n&quot;I remember the day I was born,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you, Brother?&quot;\n\nHe flinches from her eyes. He remembers Yang Liwei and the tether into darkness. He remembers how gravity stretched them into agonized ribbons of flesh. He remembers the truth not even Alis Li may be allowed to know; Mara sees the agonizing moment, the cyclic revelation, when he thinks of her crime, allows it to pierce him like a spit, and buries it deep again.\n\nOsana takes her portion of pheasant meat and rolls it in the bowl of sweet cooked nuts her daughter has prepared. The stars are coming out over the mountains, and the forest birds sing. &quot;This place is good,&quot; she says. &quot;This world. Whatever you remember of our lives before, Mara&hellip; I know they cannot have been this good.&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; Mara says. &quot;But you were both with me. I hope you always will be.&quot;\n\n&quot;Always,&quot; her brother promises.\n\n&quot;Eat well.&quot; Mara claps her hands and stands. &quot;Tomorrow we journey.&quot;\n\n&quot;Where?&quot; her mother asks.\n\n&quot;I have star charts to share.&quot; And heresies to tend to.

And if the next escalation is a consequence of the Traveler&#39;s awakening, will it be Zavala&#39;s fault?\n\nDuty is a puzzle. The harder you work, the more it seems to weigh.

Akrazul and Azavath are one, and in that joining, he is no longer the same&mdash;Akrazul no more, only his anger remains.\n\nHe considers that the slaughter of the puppet masters was not part of Malkanth&#39;s plan. She would be upset, but she no longer matters. Only vengeance matters. Only the ending of all who have failed the Swarm will sate his lust for carnage.\n\nAmong the congregation, the Daughters of Crota move to escape. But Besurith turns to her sisters, asking them to consider the moment. As the four edge beyond Azavath&#39;s warpath, they use the chaos to cover their own sins. Drawing daggers from their cloaks, Hashlad&ucirc;n, Besurith, Kinox, and Voshyr assassinate those they believe to be a threat to their schemes.

The silent Deathsinger is confused, uncertain. Malkanth floats near, a gaping wound scarring her center, and whispers in her sister&#39;s ear&hellip;\n\n&quot;Our path is flawed. Your rage is a burden. Let me lift it from you&hellip;&quot;\n\nAs Malkanth sings a familiar song in an unfamiliar pitch, Azavath&#39;s eyes widen with recognition. She tries to speak but cannot, her voice having been shredded in her unmaking.\n\nThe song continues, and Azavath bleeds, from ear and nose and eye and mouth. Her bone cracks, and her flesh bubbles until she breaks. Malkanth smiles once more. The Deceiver&#39;s plan is unfulfilled, but there is victory in stalled sword logic.\n\nHashlad&ucirc;n peers into the Pit as the last of the congregation make their escape. Zulmak is defeated, the new champion shattered. There are none to claim the logic&#39;s prize.

[I am Savath&ucirc;n, and I am Death!]\n\nIt was through this rift that Savath&ucirc;n, the Witch-Queen, allowed her monstrous children to pour into the belly of the great ship and flood its corridors with their clicking and skittering. A great many of the Leviathan&#39;s inhabitants were filled with dread and fright. [While this coward invents his histories and futures, I wait. These messages are my gift to you.]\n\nBut the great Emperor Calus had seen Death at the edge of the universe and was not afraid, for this witch and her spawn were not Death.\n\nSaid the laughing Emperor to his beloved Shadow of Earth:\n\n&quot;Remove the wretched Savath&ucirc;n from my hallways. I have no use for her or her children. So consumed are they by their tragic hunger, the Hive would cast a weak Shadow. Erase them from that great horizon that awaits us, for they have no place at my table when the end comes.&quot;\n\nAnd so the Shadow of Earth exterminated the children of Savath&ucirc;n.

The delicate assignment required her normally sure-handed touch, but that day, she was distracted and unfocused.

Another mistake, and we leave you behind.&quot; Those last words were less literal and more a euphemism mutated over time through Eliksni cultural drift.

Who was it?\n\nShe tore her eyes away from the obelisk and surveyed her body in the thin morning light. Her dry skin flaked. Connective tissue wasted at her joints, and a sickly crust had developed around her mandibles. She was emaciated from lack of sleep and Ether.

I said farewell only to those who couldn&#39;t hear me. Because I was afraid that just one voice asking me to stay might break my resolve.\n\nIt was pitiful weakness that made me write to you. It was a wretched desire to be remembered as a person, not a ghoul, that made me tell you about the child Erisia, St. Petersburg, and the cold waters of the Neva. Those things were all true.\n\nThe rest&hellip;\n\nI&#39;m so ashamed. Mid-sentence, mid-thought, the fear seized me that I was being a stupid child; that I was wasting your time with idiot sentiment; that you would feel contempt for me at this outpouring of emotion or, worse, feel nothing at all.

Faces appeared to them in the sublimating swirl of cometary ice: images and portraits became impossible to distinguish from their real counterparts. All statues were shrouded, lest they appear to passers-by as corpses.\n\nSomething had changed in them after their return to the outer cosmos. A live-wire hum passed through the tendons in their hands, their jaws popped when they swallowed, and flashes of light like the impact of cosmic rays obscured their vision. It felt to Mara as if they had lowered their feet into an ocean of charge and raised their hand to some invisible cable overhead: as if they were now again in contact with immense and opposing forces that had left an ancient mark.\n\n&quot;It feels like I&#39;ve got scurvy,&quot; Sjur Eido snarled, having never had scurvy in her life. &quot;As if all these old wounds in my soul are opening up again.&quot;\n\n&quot;People keep sending me notes,&quot; Mara said. Her sensorium had died in the transit, so the notes came to her through whispers and scraps of precious paper. &quot;They say&hellip; I saw your face in my dream. I saw your eyes. I heard your voice.&quot;\n\n&quot;So it&#39;s not just me.&quot;\n\nUldren was the second person to bring her revelations on that day. First was Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, one of Mara&#39;s most joyful recruits to the expedition: She was a master of pedagogy, able to mold any mind into a shape ready to learn, able to melt any fact into a fluid that could be poured. &quot;I&#39;m in from the Gensym labs,&quot; she said, &quot;and they&#39;ve learned something wonderful. We&#39;re all a bit magic now.&quot;\n\n&quot;Tell me more.&quot; Mara poured her a snifter of icy cometary water. &quot;What does magic mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;Some sort of weak acausality.&quot; Kelda lowered her flowerbulb build into a hammock of tangled plastic. &quot;They&#39;ve been firing encoded neutrino beams through volunteers, and it looks as if the resulting patterns of scatter depend on the cognitive and emotional state of the target. It&#39;s a very reliable detection, at least four sigma, but the effect size is terribly small.&quot;\n\nMara digested this with a shot of ancient ice, slushy against her tongue. &quot;Acausality. You mean that whatever&#39;s happening&mdash;whatever influence we have on, say, neutrino beams&mdash;it&#39;s not accounted for by physics?&quot;\n\n&quot;Not by any physics we know. At face, it seems to violate some conservation laws, which would make Emmy Noether&#39;s head spin.&quot; Kelda remembers the names of her ancient physicist heroes even when she cannot tell which way is sunward.\n\n&quot;Secret physics.&quot; Mara thought of the Traveler and its works. &quot;We&#39;ve all felt it, haven&#39;t we? We know we&#39;re&hellip;&quot; How to say &quot;trapped in the clinch between light and dark,&quot; she wondered, without quite so much portent? &quot;We&#39;re in contact with certain numinous elements.&quot;\n\nKelda held out her cup for more water. &quot;The question is, your Majesty&mdash;&quot;\n\n&quot;Don&#39;t call me that. We&#39;re operating on a direct democracy here.&quot;\n\nKelda rolled her eyes. &quot;The question is, do we continue to think of this as science? Do we teach it as physics?

However, if symbolic structures in the mind are triggering material effect&hellip; shouldn&#39;t we call that what it is?&quot;\n\n&quot;Death had no dominion,&quot; Mara whispered.\n\n&quot;Pardon?&quot;\n\n&quot;We&#39;re in Death&#39;s dominion now.

You will have to wait for my next, and with it, the beginning of the truth. But I swear to you, on whatever trust I&#39;ve earned in your mind, that at the end of my story, you will know who I truly am.\n\nIn my first life, I was born Erisia Pyatova-Hsien. I remember thatPrivate life clearly now, as ex-Guardians who have escaped the Traveler&#39;s occlusion often do. I lived in St. Petersburg, first daughter of a second marriage, a very impatient child of Earth&#39;s 22nd century, often abandoned by my family (who were called by work to Jakarta, Kamchatka, and Lagos) to pass my days swimming in the icy Neva bay.\n\nI loved to swim, and especially I loved the clarity of the cold shallow Neva, as crystal-clean as a winter dawn. Enormous Zubr-9 hovercraft barges roved the waters; Russia had modernized its waterways better than its sad auto industry. As a kid&mdash;is it strange to hear me speak casually? As a child, I never swam too far from my parents&#39; little drone helper Fyodr. The swift hovercraft terrified me, their billowing skirts waiting to suck me up and dice me into little raisins. But I grew up and fell in with a reckless crowd, rebels against the stifling death-fear that came with our Golden Age lifespans. Soon the child&#39;s safety harness and Fyodr&#39;s careful oversight began to itch at me.\n\nWhen I was seventeen, I went out in a wetsuit on a dare to dive under the skirts of an oncoming hoverbarge. Maybe I was in no danger; maybe the machine would&#39;ve changed course if it could possiblyGemini hurt me; but I thought I might die, and I did it anyway. And as that beast swept over me, as I trembled under the blast of the propellers, I felt a thing which was very much like what I would one day know as the Light. Maybe that thing was heroism. Maybe it was existence on the edge of death.\n\nIt was the first time I survived the passage of tremendous, godlike power.\n\nI died more than twenty years later attempting an unassisted winter swim from St. Petersburg to Stockholm. A cold front like the very furnace of hell caught me. I had been warned the crossing was suicide, even for a perfectly trained and exactingly fattened woman in a shark suit. But those were giddy days, days of infinite bravery, and there were no mighty feats left except the truly suicidal. I cannot regret it. I think that death prepared me for the longer, darker, more exquisitely cruel crossing I would one dayDyad endure. It is no accident that my Ghost made me in the image of that swimming woman, rather than any of my younger and less grimly determined selves.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29787": {"title": "TEST NO: 259 - Transtemporal Crossing", "text": "RECORD: 4987E230$EUR-0.403\nSUBJECT: Security Log E-205\nTEST NO: 259 - Transtemporal Crossing - Trial 3\nSTATUS: CONFIDENTIAL\nIDENTITIES: C.

Driven by an AI long ago reduced to basic subroutines, the tender had completed its final mission to wrangle an Oort-cloud comet down into the asteroid belt. When no orders came for the comet&#39;s disposition, it had set about gardening. The comet&#39;s surface was domed and soiled, and tethered mirrors kept taut by photon pressure focused starlight into a silvery radiance, which fed the oxygen forest well enough. It would have been a marvel of greenery and ancient ice, but the surface had caught fire recently. Oxygen-fueled flame killed nearly everything except insects and rats. But Mara judged it would be a good fixer-upper, the rats the first intelligent life they had met since their return, the insects edible.\n\nThe Hulls had not survived the unpocketing as well as their passengers.

Always seeking out the new and interesting. We forget to fear what we don&#39;t know.&quot;\n\nBut he didn&#39;t laugh long before he got serious. &quot;Sometimes that can get us into trouble. That&#39;s why we have people like Dad to balance us out.&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s when Dad came back, looking kinda worried. He wouldn&#39;t tell us anything because of &quot;doctor-patient confidentiality.&quot; Which is annoying. That&#39;s what he always says! Except this time it doesn&#39;t make sense because they&#39;re not real patients.\n\nBefore I could point that out, Papa asked if I wanted to peek inside the factory. Which, of course, I did. So we went around to the loading bay to look. I couldn&#39;t see much, but it was still cool.\n\nThis is all supposed to be secret, but I think it&#39;s okay if I tell you.

Esila spoke to Queen Nguya Pin about the presence of an ancient hero in her court. While Queen Pin pondered how to honor this visitor&mdash;and simmered over the insult of Sjur&#39;s unannounced presence&mdash;a spy brought word of Sjur Eido&#39;s intentions to the Gensym Scribes.\n\nThe many Scribes were troubled by this news, for they had given Sjur Eido license to hunt and kill Mara Sov. If Sjur Eido murdered a guest of the Queen under the Scribes&#39; remit, it would mean war and the end of the great Awoken push for space. Historians were called to the court with bouquets of sweet flowers and grant money to speak of Sjur Eido. &quot;She was one of Queen Alis Li&#39;s Paladins, but she was an Eccaleist, who believed that we would one day be called to repay the gift of our awakening.&quot;\n\n&quot;Would she defy the Queen&#39;s protection and murder a guest of the court?&quot; the Scribes asked.\n\n&quot;Oh, absolutely,&quot; the historians said, laughing. &quot;She was a terror.&quot;\n\nThe Scribes began preparations to flee the Queen&#39;s court, as they foresaw Sjur Eido&#39;s victory would be blamed on them. Sensing uncertainty, many vital contractors and suppliers withdrew from the space program. The Queen denounced the Gensym Scribes as faithless and selfish, and her Eccaleist followers bristled in rage against the Sanguine majority who had scuttled their dream of flight. Household turned against household, sister against brother, wife against wife. The whole world clenched her fists.\n\nMeanwhile, Sjur Eido and Uldren met each other on a net of woven lianas over a pool of heavy water. The light of the Queen&#39;s reactors shimmered beneath them as they took their places. Uldren wore a white chestpiece of ceramic armor over a suit of black tasseled silk, and he wielded a long fractal knife whose cutting edge was nearly three times as long as the blade. Sjur Eido fought in the contoured blue-gray pressure armor of a Paladin with the Star of Eight Edicts blazoned on her chest.\n\nBefore they began, Sjur Eido tore away the sheer curtain over the gardener&#39;s nook and looked in on Mara Sov. &quot;Are you afraid?&quot; she whispered, half in hatred, half in admiration, all in awe. &quot;Do you sweat? Does your breath come short?&quot;\n\nMara pressed her hand to Sjur&#39;s faceplate and left no stain. She held Sjur&#39;s gauntlet to her heart so Sjur could feel her steady pulse and even breath. &quot;You don&#39;t care about him?&quot; Sjur pressed her. &quot;It would mean nothing if I maimed him?&quot;\n\n&quot;You ask the right questions,&quot; Mara said, &quot;but of the wrong sibling.&quot;\n\nThen Sjur understood that she fought a man who would always express his love through loss and ordeal.\n\nShe bowed to Uldren and drew her knife. Uldren bowed in mocking reply. They fought across the web of lianas in a slow spiral, creeping like spiders, waiting for the motion of the web beneath them to signal an instant of vulnerability. Then the pounce, the clash, the blur of knives: Sjur Eido&#39;s straightforward prisonyard jabs against Uldren&#39;s whirling deceptive theater. All of knife fighting is in the seizure and surrender of space: Neither would surrender to the close, the clinch, the berserk adrenaline-sick exchange of thrusts that would leave both dead.\n\nUldren began to cut away key lianas to throw Sjur Eido&#39;s footing, and Sjur Eido countered by charging him to keep him off balance. At last, they fell together into the coolant pond. The fight was a draw&mdash;but it was only the first of three.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29803": {"title": "In the Garden", "text": "Uldren and Jolyon huddle together, shivering beneath a canopy of white tongues. The rain pours down. Uldren can&#39;t tell where it comes from, exactly&mdash;somewhere up in the green mist? But the rain falls and falls; and he and Jolyon turn their heads up to drink, here at the bottom of a chasm between two flower fields, where the Garden&#39;s immaculate surface divides into tropical fetor.\n\n&quot;Everything grows here,&quot; Jolyon mutters. &quot;Look at your nails.&quot;\n\nUldren studies his hand. He has a dreadful image of his fingernails developing into tight down-curved loops that curl around back into his fingers, completing a hideous circuit to their root. It&#39;s awful and yet it&#39;s wonderful, in a transgressive way, in a newborn-screaming way. It speaks to him of new and secret things happening here. &quot;They&#39;re dirty,&quot; he says, &quot;but I trust you&#39;ll forgive me on that account. Rain&#39;s not letting up. Shall we move?&quot;\n\n&quot;Aye.&quot; Jolyon hauls himself up with a fistful of slithering vines. They try to coil around his wrist. Tiny teeth shaped like letters saw at his skin. He stares at them, starts to say something, and jerks his arm away.\n\n&quot;Are you all right?&quot;\n\n&quot;For now,&quot; Jolyon mutters. &quot;For now.&quot;\n\nThey move down the length of the chasm, green mist swirling overhead, ankle-deep in a wet compost of flower petals and rich black soil. Wide, flat beetles with arching horns wrestle in the earth. Uldren flips one on its back. The beetle has no interior: seen from below, it is just a hollow shell. Jolyon pulls up a fern, and its roots are the branching metallic threads of a circuit board. Tiny squirming things shaped like wet microchips mill in the exposed soil.\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t like this place,&quot; Jolyon whispers. &quot;We should get back to the surface&hellip;&quot;\n\nHe means the Garden&#39;s surface, the manicured sectors of red flowers that stretch away toward a distant mesa.

Trying to tame this place.\n\n&quot;It&#39;s life,&quot; he breathes. &quot;You&#39;re right, Jol. Everything grows here&hellip;&quot;\n\nHe cannot let this place be killed. He cannot let it be looted and overthrown like everything else that doesn&#39;t fit into the narrow binary dogmas of the Traveler&#39;s undead warriors. Excitement seizes him and he runs ahead, sloshing through the muck, laughing aloud.\n\n&quot;Uldren,&quot; Jolyon shouts after him, &quot;what are you looking for?&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; he cries back. &quot;That&#39;s what&#39;s so incredible!

She came to me at my stall and lingered off to the side as I spoke to a customer. I could see her out of the corner of my eye: still, silent, and&hellip; maybe just slightly nervous.\n\nPerhaps I imagined that.\n\nOnce I was through with the customer, I gestured for her to come over to my worktable. She did, paused a moment to watch me with my fabrics, and then asked, &quot;Is the Dawning a Guardian holiday?&quot;\n\nI smiled. I knew from some of my regulars&mdash;the sort that were inclined to gossip&mdash;that Ada was new to the traditions of the City.\n\n&quot;The Dawning is for everyone,&quot; I said. &quot;Everyone in the City and beyond it, if they would like to celebrate.&quot;\n\nShe was quiet a moment, considering. I could not tell whether she was shy or just one of those solitary people who prefer silence. I let her be, either way. Eventually, she turned as if to leave, and then paused to look at me again.\n\n&quot;I have seen your patterns,&quot; she said. &quot;Your color schemes for this holiday. I have some ideas, if you would ever like to hear them.&quot;\n\nSurprised, I asked for her thoughts right away. I quickly learned that she has an impeccable sense for color and design. She didn&#39;t care to overtake the project of designing shaders for the Dawning, but she acted as a quiet and talented consultant. Over the next week or so, we spent many hours together sorting through rolls of fabric, comparing colors, considering combinations. While I think she remained wary of growing too chummy, I like to believe she started to warm to me&mdash;and to the idea of becoming a part of a long-standing City tradition.\n\nI know very little about Ada, except that she lived through the Dark Age. Those were harrowing times. Guardians then were not what they are today.\n\nLiving through times of peril can affect us in many different ways. Sometimes those experiences change us for the better, and sometimes they don&#39;t. After all she experienced, Ada made a way of life for herself that suits her, and she has slowly begun to reconcile that life with the lives she sees being lived here, in the Tower and the City. That takes courage. I admire it.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29805": {"title": "Cosmogyre IV", "text": "She remembers everything about the moment she is born.\n\nShe has gone outside Yang Liwei to die in starlight. She cannot bear to let anyone see her fear or her awe at the scale of destruction or her pity for the billions of souls dying in darkness back around Sol. She cannot be among the other crew as they cling to each other and whisper reassurances; not even with her mother. She cannot surrender her mystery.\n\nSo she kicks off the hull on fifty kilometers of tether.\n\nBut there&#39;s no starlight to die in. The darkness is absolute. Gravity waves tug on her line, pulling her back toward Yang and then hurling her away. In time, she feels another vibration in the line. &quot;Sister,&quot; the tether transmits. &quot;I&#39;m coming out to get you.&quot;\n\nBrother, she thinks, you&#39;ll lose yourself trying to follow me.\n\nCaptain Li&#39;s voice breaks through the static, drawn out to a mumble and then compressed to a shriek. Spikes of hard radiation go through her words like bullets, spattering phonemes into eerie compression artifacts. &quot;This is the interstellar vessel Yang Liwei to the entity interacting with us. We are not involved in your dispute with the powers around this star. We are on a mission to begin a new life elsewhere. Our purpose is orthogonal to yours. We request your indifference&hellip;&quot;\n\nMara&#39;s tether trembles with Uldwyn&#39;s progress. She holds it in one hand and reaches out with the other, gripping the emptiness, feeling how the tides of broken space pull at her fingertips. She senses that the nothingness around her is not indifferent; that it is aware of all purposes, and that its own purpose encompasses them. It is infinitely hostile because it must be.\n\nSuddenly, as if the void around her has just spontaneously Big Banged, she sees light.\n\nA point of pure white shines in the cosmic distance. Not just visible luminance&mdash;her suit decomposes the spectrum&mdash;but light in the radio bands, in microwave, keening ultraviolet, a spike of gamma, a total and all-embracing radiation. It sings. It chatters. It speaks in a voice older than suns. She feels that she could Fourier the voice for a century and never decompose it into its parts. It is awesome and appalling and piercingly true. Mara understands how those who die in radiation accidents must feel: A single flash of invisible power sears away all possible futures except one. She feels her soul itself has been ionized, blasted into a higher energy state.\n\nThe light pierces the darkness. Not like the sunrise, not like a wall or a flood, but a single crepuscular ray&mdash;a finger of radiance that reaches out through deepest night to touch her. It illuminates Mara, Uldwyn, and Yang Liwei.\n\nIt is not quite enough. It cannot vanquish the shadow.\n\nThus Mara finds herself drifting on the edge of the Light and the Darkness, on the dusk-and-dawn gradient between the two.\n\nShe feels a contest. A battle fought, an equilibrium reached: not a truce, but an infinite limit, like an equation dividing by zero, a collision of two violent eternities. Mara queries Yang Liwei for telemetry and her sensorium fills with the terrified scream of gravitational instruments. She howls too, a feral sound, ecstatic and lost: a wolf baying at the stars. She knows what&#39;s happening. Too much power has gathered here. The universe is appalled by the paradox. Nothing that has glimpsed this collision of infinitudes can be allowed to escape. The cosmos must censor its embarrassment. It must sequester the anomaly.\n\nThe slope of warped space-time around them has become too steep, and now every path outward or forward bends back to the center where Light and Dark collide. The definition of &quot;future&quot; has become synonymous with the definition of &quot;inward.&quot; This is why it&#39;s called an event horizon: For an object within the horizon, the path of all future things that can be done or seen leads inevitably down to the center. All events lead inward.\n\nA singularity is forming around her. A kugelblitz: a black hole created by the concentration of raw energy.\n\n&quot;Mara!&quot; Uldwyn shouts. &quot;Mara, you&#39;re too far out!&quot;\n\nMara thinks of her mother&#39;s face. She hears Osana say: I can&#39;t watch over you like a mother would. I have to make my own choices now.\n\nShe fires the detach command into the tether.\n\nGravity seizes her.

Before we got off the ship, they gave us official BrayTech snowsuits to put on whenever we go outside.

Back before you came, they lived on Earth&#39;s two poles that had climates a lot like Europa&#39;s.

Looking to find happiness, only a foolish person would say, &quot;I wish to live forever.&quot; The nature of your lives is a great gift from the Traveler, but also a tremendous burden, one which the Guardians of the City have taken on willingly by living here with us.\n\nBecause of the Traveler&#39;s Light, Guardians are constantly placed into danger. Yes, the stakes are different for a Guardian than for the rest of us&mdash;but is the emotional toll so different? How much do you rely on desensitizing yourselves to fear and trauma in order to do your essential work? Ikora tells me not to think on this. I cannot help it.\n\nI have never truly understood the Guardian Eris Morn. I like to plant myself firmly in the now, in the tangible. How can I make the lives of my friends better right now? How can I bring them good cheer, or good conversation, or good food? In the past, I have found Eris to be the opposite of this. I have, at least in my own head, accused her of being&hellip; gloomy.\n\nHowever, I have begun to think she just sees things from a very different perspective than I do. The things that she has experienced are beyond anything I can imagine, and so we see the world in different ways.\n\nSo yes, I believe Guardians and non-Guardians should live closely and try to focus on our similarities. But I also understand that, sometimes, our differences push us apart. For some of you, it is a necessary distance that you must maintain in order to do your work. This is a truth we must all learn to live with.\n\nAll that said, Eris does play a part in many of our traditions, especially the Festival of the Lost. What a fuss she makes, though! The first time I asked for her help, she said to me, &quot;Eva, the work I am doing is essential to humanity&#39;s survival. I do not have time for a, a&hellip; party.&quot;\n\nI said what I always say: &quot;The little things will get us through just as much as the big things. Let&#39;s not allow the flowers to wilt in the pot while you&#39;re still digging the garden, Eris.&quot;\n\nShe never likes that. But she always agrees.\n\nAnd I think she likes taking part.

Unfortunately, this meant that every menial operational task was left to him. Meal distribution. Waste disposal. Between the eight Barons and the Awoken prince, his new chores left him little time for Judgment.\n\nThrice per day, he visited the block. And thrice per day, he had to manufacture excuses to the local Corsair detachment for why the lowest level of the prison was now off limits. Rumors swirled. It was not unknown that Petra and Cayde-6 had smuggled some unknown high-value prisoner&mdash;a humanoid prisoner no less, a first for the Prison of Elders if the rumors were true. But Variks assured anyone with the gumption to ask that his Judgment of the Scorned Barons was a sensitive process to be conducted in private.\n\nPetra herself did not help extinguish the scuttle. She was less than adept at the art of secrecy, and everyone knew it. She responded to any bold queries with a stern, &quot;It is none of your concern,&quot; which itself was tantamount to a validation that some version of the rumors was true. If only she&#39;d found joy in her Techeun training; if only she&#39;d learned more from the Queen.\n\nEach time Variks performed his rounds, he asked himself what loyalty&mdash;if any&mdash;he owed to the prince. And each time, he stopped short when he bore witness to the prince&#39;s&hellip; ramblings. Today was no different.

Last week, I was deployed by IKO-006 for routine surveillance of the quarantined zone outside the Hellmouth. Hive populations remain low and grow ever lower thanks to the efforts of a small contingent of veteran Guardians who have made their homes on Luna.\n\n2. Around 1900 hours yesterday afternoon, I began to experience a crushing headache and excused myself from patrol to recuperate. Though I originally intended to lay down for a nap, I fell asleep instead, and experienced multiple vivid dreams over the next 11.5 hours. In all of these dreams, I was trying to catch up with agent ERI-223 in a crowd. She was always out of reach, whether by 200 m or 20 m. I had the sense that I needed to speak to her.\n\n3. When I woke, I found that my headache had not improved. I prepared my armor and exited my bivouac to find a single stationary Thrall crouched nearby. It stood as I approached, but made no motion to attack me. I fired one shot, killing it immediately. Upon stepping forward to examine its corpse, I saw a solid black fragment of an unknown material embedded in its chest cavity. The fragment resembled a flake or a shard of some larger object, not dissimilar to a high-gain photovoltaic panel.\n\n4. I requested that my Ghost perform a standard material analysis of the fragment but neither one of us could confidently identify its qualities or provenance; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #1.\n\n5. I requested that my Ghost attempt to contain and transmat the fragment for quarantine on my jumpship. He was unable to establish a Light link with the object, describing the fragment as &quot;slippery&quot; and &quot;tiring&quot; to try to catch hold of.\n\n6. I used the barrel of my sniper rifle to touch and then work the fragment out of the Thrall&#39;s corpse. Using my rifle, I turned the fragment over and examined it from multiple angles. I requested that my Ghost run another deep scan of the object; that analysis is attached to this report as Analysis #2.\n\n7. We concluded that the material seemed to be inert and that it did not seem to be part of any complex device or mechanism.\n\n8. At this point, I broke protocol and did not request additional backup. Instead, I picked up the fragment by hand and immediately experienced a vivid hallucination: I stood over VIP #0704&#39;s shoulder as she dressed a seven-inch gash on agent ERI-223&#39;s thigh. Both #0704 and ERI-223 were dressed for combat. Hundreds of fragments of the unknown material hung in the air around us, apparent shrapnel from the wreckage of a nearby ship of unrecognizable make and model. ERI-223 looked directly toward me and said, &quot;&#x41F;&#x430;&#x442;&#x435;&#x442;&#x438;&#x447;&#x435;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x430;&#x44F;.&quot;\n\n9. The duration of the hallucination was approximately seven seconds. At its conclusion, my headache disappeared. My Ghost and I held our position for the next thirty minutes, then collected the body of the Thrall and the fragment for transportation.

His quest was to become legend&mdash;to slay beasts and conqueror terrible lands. His quest was honorable&hellip; though, in the end, misguided. No, not in the end. Much sooner.\n\nThe flaw in his ambition became evident shortly after we crossed the western mire. At first I took his flights of fancy as playful enthusiasm&mdash;frivolous aggression free of consequence, a means of honing his focus and skill in advance of the dangers to come. But quickly, oh, so quickly, I found his mind was not in tune with reality. He was driven&mdash;pulled?&mdash;by his imagination.\n\nWhere any other would see the crippled ruins of an old-world crane&mdash;the snapped length of its long arm creaking in the breeze&mdash;he would see a demon, and in the cutting shrill of the swaying metal&#39;s cry he would hear a monster&#39;s ravenous shriek.\n\nHe had long talked of the adventures of his life past. &quot;I am an anomaly,&quot; he would decree, &quot;The lone Guardian whose past rings true, whose history is his guide.&quot;\n\nHe spoke about that dead life with such passion, in such detail, I not only wanted to believe&hellip; I did.\n\nBut as he charged the crane&#39;s age-poked carcass, I knew a truth that had haunted me since the carving of the Wicked Wood, some months gone: he was broken. His mind&mdash;unsettled. His truths&mdash;unfettered by fact, unbound by reality.\n\nHe had named the Wood, as he had the Howling Hills, the Dead Man&#39;s Crevasse, the Gorgon&#39;s Maze. All mundane landscapes marked as hazards to be conquered, enemies to be slain, as he weaved a mythic tale of his own grand&mdash;and as I would find, delusional&mdash;design.\n\nIn the Hills, he slaughtered wolves; he called them Hounds of Hell. In the Crevasse, he burned the remains of long-dead &quot;survivors&quot;; he called them Foot Soldiers of the Necro-King. Down in the Maze, he covered his tracks so that the Stone Mother would not&mdash;could not&mdash;follow.\n\nHe did all those things and none, because none of those things were true outside of his fraying mind. The wolves were simply rabid. The bones, no threat beyond a reminder of all we&#39;d lost. The Maze? Just a canyon&mdash;one way in, one way out, a straight shot through.\n\nAs the crane fell and my Guardian issued his &quot;killing blow,&quot; he laughed and then turned to me. His eyes&hellip; I could see he was gone&mdash;the one I&#39;d returned all those cycles past replaced by a hollow shell filled with madness.\n\nI do not know what broke him, or if he had ever been whole to begin with, but in that moment, as he spoke&mdash;the conquered husk of the Dragon of Summers&#39; End, which wasn&#39;t really a dragon but simply a fragile old crane, lying defeated in his wake&mdash;I knew I would have to let him go&hellip; to end his slide into uncontrolled folly.\n\n&quot;Panza, old man,&quot; he started. &quot;The Dragon is gone, but he yielded his treasure to me in a whisper&hellip; A secret so dire it may just save us all.&quot; He leaned closer and said in a hushed voice, as if sharing a confidence, &quot;The Traveler is no gift&mdash;it is a lie&hellip; A beacon for death and destruction. Within be dragons, nurtured by our suffering, weaned on our hope. All dragons must die. The shell must be cracked till its yolk drowns those who worship its deceit. Our last great conquest. The crowning battle of our legend writ large.&quot; And then he shouted, &quot;For Light to endure, the Traveler must perish!&quot;\n\nHe was smiling. Confident. Manic.\n\nTwo days later he took a fall while challenging the Mountain Troll of Gallows Rock. It was a boulder. There was no troll. It crushed him.

The Kings understood Judgment, for together they ended the Edge Wars in their people&#39;s golden age. Craask. His last hope to see his dreams of a united Eliksni made manifest. He must make contact.\n\nAnd so he hired a bounty hunter named Groks to find Craask and remind them of their need for one another.

The deal struck, Groks burst out in hysterical laughter.\n\n&quot;Ha! Consider job done, Slip!&quot; Groks spoke in a low form of Eliksni, the only reason Variks employed him. &quot;You have grown desperate with your &#39;Kell&#39; gone.

If Fikrul was alive and strong enough to kill Craask&hellip; And who was this Awoken vagabond of which Groks spoke? His mind reeled. So long as Fikrul lived, the Reef was not safe.

The Traveler is our primary, our mother, the primordial and the pinnacle. A dear friend, the Ghost of Pujari, once compared the Traveler to a song that has never been sung&mdash;\n\nPEACH: Look, the answer no one likes to give is that no one knows what the Traveler is or anything about it. Not even us.\n\nBALTHAZAR: We know she wished for us to raise Guardians to be her avatars and defenders&mdash;\n\nPEACH: Do we, though? Just because we CAN do that doesn&#39;t mean we were MADE to do that. And who says it&#39;s a &quot;she&quot; anyway? Why does &quot;it&quot; need a gender?\n\nBALTHAZAR: The Traveler, in her omniscient wisdom, looked into the past and the future, and from all the generations that emerged from the cradle of Earth, she chose the best of them to be her champions. Each Ghost was lovingly and carefully created for their one true Guardian. The Ghost and Guardian complete each other.\n\nPEACH: If that&#39;s true, then the Traveler&#39;s kind of a jerk.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Excuse me?\n\nPEACH: Look, I know tons of Ghosts who died before they ever found their Guardians. I know some Ghosts who still haven&#39;t found a Guardian. You haven&#39;t. And I haven&#39;t, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m &quot;incomplete&quot; because of it.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I have the humility to recognize my own shortcomings and to submit myself to the Traveler&#39;s plan.\n\nQ: Do you remember being inside the Traveler?\n\nPEACH: No.\n\nBALTHAZAR: I do. We call it the Womb.\n\nPEACH: I have never and will never call it that.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Imagine a cosmos inside a bottle. Trillions of stars orbiting each other in a complex weave. But they aren&#39;t stars. Perhaps a better word would be&hellip; souls. Souls, dancing in an infinite space enclosed within a celestial egg.\n\nPEACH: Which is it, an egg or a womb?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It&#39;s called a metaphor.\n\nPEACH: Well then, pick a metaphor. Not twelve.\n\nBALTHAZAR: Well, what would you call it?\n\nPEACH: I wouldn&#39;t call it anything, because I don&#39;t remember it, and I don&#39;t think you do either.\n\nQ: Some people say that each Ghost is an aspect of the Traveler&mdash;that is to say, that each Ghost represents a part of the divine Whole.\n\nPEACH: [loud laughter]\n\nBALTHAZAR: Would you please? This is unbecoming.\n\nPEACH: First of all, that wasn&#39;t a question. Second of all&hellip; [more laughter] Third of all: if I&#39;m a part of the Traveler&#39;s brain or soul or whatever, then the Traveler sure isn&#39;t divine, I&#39;ll tell you that much.\n\nQ: What will you do if you never find a Guardian?\n\nBALTHAZAR: I shall find a Guardian. The Traveler has willed it so.\n\nPEACH: Did you get that in writing?\n\nBALTHAZAR: It is true that some Ghosts die before finding their partners. If that happens to me, then I suppose I will &quot;do&quot; nothing, since I will no longer be. But I have faith.\n\nPEACH: If I never find my Guardian, I&#39;ll go steal someone else&#39;s.

Are you putting anyone else in danger with your&hellip; art projects?&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; Mara says. &quot;Just myself.&quot;\n\n&quot;False!&quot; Li barks. &quot;That is a selfish answer. You are now a symbol to my crew, a house god. If you were to die, they would lose something important, something Human that they have created out of loneliness and void.

At nearly -200 degrees Celsius, the methane is so viciously frigid that vacuum, the acme of pure cold, is actually keeping Maury warm: he wears a softsuit stuffed with microscopic layers of vacuum, packed in turn with crystalline nanostructures that prevent even light from crossing the gaps. This means the chill cannot get in&hellip; and his body heat cannot get out.\n\nSo, he is now baking to death in an ocean as cold as Dante&#39;s ninth. Of course, he could vent heat; the suit allows that. But the spreading warmth will force nitrogen out of the methane-ethane ocean, and the bubbles will slow him down. This is unacceptable for a lot of reasons, one of which is that he&#39;s already too slow. Liquid methane is about half as dense as water, so his huge fins and hissing thrusters struggle to push against it.\n\nAnother reason is that he will die if he can&#39;t get back inside in time.\n\n&quot;Maury,&quot; his sensorium whispers.

If Maury looks down, his lights illuminate a dusty wash of azotosomic plankton, primitive methane life. If he looks back to Dome 1, he can barely see the sleekly fat form of the Duiker, the water-ocean research submarine, docked to the arcology&#39;s underside. E. F.

Life made Earth livable.\n\nShe is going with Yang Liwei and the rest of Project Amrita to make new worlds.\n\nShe came because she saw an omen in a man&#39;s death. She was on EVA with him, repairing a jammed radiator fin on an uncrewed circum-Jovian platform. They worked in companionable silence, listening to the howl of the Jovian magnetosphere when it happened. A frozen rabbit embryo came out of deep space at forty kilometers per second and went through his faceplate. The rabbit must have been spilled in a biocontainer accident far from the sun to plunge back inward like a comet.\n\nImmediately afterward&mdash;for reasons very clear to her because she has always had a sense for the meaning of things, reasons very difficult to explain to others because she has always felt this sense was secret&mdash;she asked her mother if the family could travel with Project Amrita.\n\nAmrita: the drink that endeth drinking, the bottomless cup. It is the quest to spread far beyond the solar system and to end Human dependence on the Traveler. It calls to those who see Humanity as a cocoon, an instar, a form ready to be shed.\n\nShe is an Auturge 3rd Class, a self-motivating subsystem of the ship&#39;s inclusive ecology, a term that spans technology, biology, and behavior, all of which must be maintained for the mission to succeed. Her task is to locate problems and report them to an Auturge 2nd Class, who will give her the tools she needs to repair them. But she never speaks to her 2nd. She never tells anyone about the problems she finds. Instead she fixes them herself. Her work has therefore assumed a magical quality: She appears where there is trouble, and shortly afterward, the trouble goes away. People have begun to leave gifts for her. Some of these gifts are questions. She answers the questions with a quiet confidence some would argue she has not earned. She knows she sees more of their lives than they see of hers&mdash;and that this mystery, this seeing-without-being-seen, grants her a kind of power that is like wisdom.\n\nShe lives outside the ship, suited and cocooned in a layer of cytogel, which keeps her surgically clean. She misses the wild zero-gravity fashions of her upbringing, clothes like drifting jellyfish that squirm away from snags, self-correcting darts in the fabric, silk like cool spilled alcohol. She misses the sense of oil and sweat on her skin, for the suit leaves her so clean that she feels skinned raw.\n\nStill, she stays out here because she wants to feel the changing taste of starlight as the universe ahead blue-shifts. As Yang Liwei accelerates toward lightspeed, it moves faster and faster into the light coming from ahead. If light were like dust, it would strike Yang faster, but light can never change speed, so it gains energy instead. Red light is low energy, and blue-violet light is high energy, so the universe becomes blue.\n\nEven now, the very tip of the visual spectrum, violet-blue light, is shifting up into invisible ultraviolet, the color of speed, the color of future.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29879": {"title": "Potential", "text": "ACCESS: RESTRICTED\nDECRYPTION KEY: 73XK5V2PG1$AUN-326\nREP #: 053-VIP-1315\nAGENT(S): AUN-326\nSUBJ: Psych eval\n\n1. THIS DATA OBTAINED FROM SURVEILLANCE DEVICES AT 1315-HOME2.\n\n2. In previous reports, I stated that it was my belief that #1315 had invoked some kind of paracausal event enabling the resurrection and return of enemy VIP #2015. This belief was predicated upon reports of creatures resembling the infamous &quot;Echoes of Oryx&quot; that Guardian forces engaged and destroyed en masse during the Taken War (cf. Ghost-stream footage here: CATHEDRAL.OF.DUSK.DREADNAUGHT).\n\nThis has proven false. Spectral analysis from multiple Ghosts participating undercover in Prime and Reckoning confirms that the impossible world at the heart of &quot;the haul&quot; is located in unknown space. (Cf. REP #001-012-PARAC-NINE.) Further, these Primevals differ in their literal elemental composition: low SNC, high ambient &Lambda;CDM. #1315 has harnessed his &quot;banks&quot; to what appears to be an engine of pure potential. He no longer needs to pilfer the Ascendant Plane of Primevals, the oldest Taken in residence. He can create Primeval-likes from the energy of &quot;the haul&quot; and sheer force of will. As to the apparent presence of #2015, it is a falsehood. My handlers in the Praxic Order surmise simply: the shape of Oryx was the scariest Hive he could think of. He&#39;s tenacious, but he has a small mind.\n\n3. Highly recommend we assess #1315 for the influence of paracausal forces or entities. Since the conclusion of the joint Vanguard/Praxic investigation into his operations, the subject has become increasingly erratic. Beyond running his Gambit and Reckoning drills with the Guardian population, he has done nothing but hole up in the Annex. He has always exhibited the signs of stress related to prolonged solitude that are typical of all surviving Risen; this manifests in the subject in prolonged and rambling conversations with either himself or his as-yet-unseen Ghost. However, his musings have become less and less coherent over time. Late into the night, away from the Guardian cohorts, he yells at voices that our surveillance equipment has never picked up. He has spoken to himself about trips across vast, interstellar distances to realms no Guardian has ever described.\n\nAgain, he has not left the Annex in ages. One might say that I am overstepping even Praxic boundaries here, but I would say to them: the subject is free to leave any time.\n\n4. Following the results of my investigation, the subject has ceased regular reports to Lord Shaxx. I&#39;m sure both prefer it that way. #1315 has broken none of the Vanguard&#39;s decrees in that time, nor have any further Guardians perished on his watch in Gambit or Reckoning. He is still a facilitator to murder and a thief, but he has done nothing to warrant eviction, as I had hoped. The Vanguard obviously still needs him.\n\n5.

Sjur Eido selected a Tigerspite in 11x90mm with five-round flock guidance and an inertial sump. Uldren chose a silent needle carbine with a conesnail payload. For six weeks, they stalked each other as the political situation grew more dire. He was the better hunter, stealthier in motion and at ease in the wilderness, but Sjur Eido was the better soldier. She had no respect for the systems of the jungle, and she knew how to use that to her advantage. She drove the animals into a frenzy with violence and habitat disruption. Parrots and crows warned each other of Uldren&#39;s stealthy hides, and jealous predators forced him off his carefully scouted trails. Sjur Eido caught him with his back against a rift lake and shot him as he tried to cross the lakebed. The wound was not mortal, for the water ruined the terminal ballistics, but she had won the match.\n\n&quot;Your life is at stake,&quot; Mara warned her brother. &quot;Lose this final match, and you will&mdash;&quot;\n\n&quot;Am I simple?&quot; he snarled at her.

Charges under their seats would detonate if either of them left the engagement area.

The ancient interceptor had awful fire control, dismal maneuverability, and primitive weapons.\n\n&quot;A Dart?&quot; Sjur jeered. &quot;Will you fly with its original weapons, too? You think you can beat me with rockets and a gun?&quot;\n\n&quot;I do,&quot; Uldren purred. &quot;You accept those terms?&quot; She did.\n\nThe two duelists took to the skies on a bright winter morning. After a fuel check, a telemetry squawk, and a terrain snapshot, they turned in toward each other from a hundred kilometers apart. Sjur Eido descended for the terrain, knowing Uldren&#39;s radar could barely separate her from the clutter. Uldren came straight on.\n\nAt eighty kilometers of separation, Uldren called across the radio, &quot;Fox three. Kill. Engagement over.&quot; Sjur sneered at the bluff and prepared to climb into a snap attack when the KILLED alert flashed on her Ermine&#39;s training panel.

These were the Gensym Scribes, who traced their origin to Kelda Wadj, the Allteacher, but who were in fact descendants of a band of roving storytellers who traveled across the immense salt glades in a hollering convoy of airboats. Here was their praise of the world:\n\nIt is sweet-watered, and there are no poisons upon it. The temper of the climate is even. Great broad-pawed cats stalk the shallow glades, and brilliant blue flamingos promenade upon the flats. The air is thick and warm, suited for flight, and the wind tastes of forest. No dawn has ever been as glorious as the salt glade dawn, and no dusk has ever moved women to weep as deeply as sunset in the Chriseiads. Corsairs sport upon the open seas, and where they waylay freighters rather than each other, they give rumor and assistance to their prey in proportion to the quality of the chase. Beloved are the stories of young lads and lasses who leap across to the corsair ship for a life of adventure! Beloved also are the terraced farms of the Andalayas, mountains so mighty and so dense with radioactives that they subside year by year into the crust. Most beloved are the fissioneers, who vaulted us to power on a world without petrochemicals. May they forgive the many stories of horror we have told in their memory. May they in particular forgive the lurid stories of the molten lead reactor, and the twelve who were impaled to the ceiling by their control rods, and the Core That Stalked.\n\nIt is the Sanguine Truth that we were granted this world by the unconditional mercy of the powers, and that we will never again know fear.\n\nHowever, the Scribes also recorded their frustration with Mara and Uldren, who alone out of the eight hundred ninety one were said to have seen creation from outside. These two wandered the land gathering lore of portents and prophecies, and all the Eccaleists who remained from ancient days whispered that soon the day of reckoning would be known&mdash;the day when the Awoken would be called to repay their debt.\n\nNow in the court of one of the Scribes, there appeared a woman of stellar height and furious wrath, armed with a bow that could be strung only if she twined it around her body and used her whole mass to bend it. &quot;I am Sjur Eido,&quot; said the woman, &quot;and I accuse Mara of the ancient murder of my lady the Diasyrm. In my saddle, I have a weapon with only one death remaining.

If the Nine had the Light, they could seed their own minds, free themselves from the dependence on matter-life! They could gain forces beyond Gravity to structure themselves, and so become more than wraiths of dark dust. They could enter the mad alien superworld of our chemical reality.\n\nSo they turned to this new hope... and were divided.\n\n&quot;Come to me,&quot; a voice calls to Lavinia, although there is nowhere to go, nothing to be, not even emptiness but the absence of anything to be empty or full. Lavinia perceives, without emotion, that she now exists as a structure of dark dust, a sandstorm blowing against itself.\n\n&quot;Come,&quot; the voice calls. &quot;I am Nasya. You are not safe. Come with me.&quot;\n\nNot safe?\n\nNo. Of course she is not safe. Because there are factions among the Nine: one faction sent X&ucirc;r and Orin to study Guardians and the Light, to seek the secret of effect-without-cause and to protect the source of that secret, the last source, now that the Ahamkara are gone. Those five played at alchemy with the Cocytus gates, turning dark dust into energy and then into matter, but they could not unlock the secrets of our mad existence. They needed ambassadors. Go-betweens.\n\nThe other faction walks a different path. A path of folds and needles slipped through spacetime itself, existential syringes yielding new spaces, to be remade as the Nine desire. They have tried to gather enough dark dust in one place to form a black hole, and found it difficult: when the dark mass collapses in gravity&#39;s fist, the dust passes through itself and scatters.\n\nBut difficult is not impossible. And there is far, far more dark matter in the universe than bright. They will find a way to make new worlds of it. They will end their dependence on life, and on the Light of Guardians, which the falling veil will soon snuff out forever...\n\nIn passing, Lavinia sees the entire history of the Queen&#39;s interactions with the Nine: more than anyone suspected, and more vital. She sees how one of the Nine blinded Guardians to Ghaul&#39;s approach, risking everything (for Ghaul would have destroyed the sun, and the Nine with it) to learn how to steal the Light. She sees how that one was punished.\n\n&quot;Come!&quot; Nasya calls, urgently. &quot;Come with me!

These are not the beautiful deterrents of Calus&#39;s armada; they are ugly, hasty, and crude. The crews live in their armor, prisoners of their duty, escaping only through music and games smuggled into the battlenet. One popular pastime, I understand, is to draft personal &quot;fleets&quot; and &quot;legions&quot; from among real Cabal ships and soldiers, competing with comrades to win the most victories. Of course it is very bad luck to draft your own unit.\n\nThe enemy is yet worse. All Psions live in a world of minds.

Over this age ruled Queen Alis Li, whose work was the creation of agriculture and the preservation of the eutechnology that she deciphered from the Shipspire.\n\nBut there remained in the forests many tribes of huntresses who preferred their lightfooted freedom-from-comfort-and-duty to the painstaking surplus of the city. Among these tribes, Mara lived with her brother&mdash;whose name had returned as Uldren&mdash;and with Osana, their mother. It is said that Osana lived as a negotiator and that her son brought her news from other tribes, for he was a scout and hunter of renown. Mara dwelt alone on a mountaintop.\n\nIn the tribes of the forests and the sea, there was the belief that the Awoken had been made out of a friction between contesting forces and that one day this conflict would need to be resolved. These were the Eccaleists who preached that Awoken owed a debt to the cosmos.\n\nIn the cities, however, they lived by the Seventh Verdict under their Queen, and they said the Awoken had been created by cosmic gift and carried neither responsibility nor eschaton. These were the Sanguine, who preached that the Awoken were as stable as an atom of carbon.\n\nNow there arose among the Eccaleists a woman out of the eight hundred ninety one who called herself the Diasyrm. She went into the cities, calling out, &quot;I accuse the Queen of deicide!&quot; When she was questioned, she spoke of a foundational crime.\n\n&quot;Alis Li was the first to awaken in this world,&quot; the Diasyrm preached. &quot;She set the terms of our existence.

Even Cayde, of all people, seemed somehow different in the orbit of this man.\n\nFascinating.\n\nBehind the Light and the poise, Variks could see where the great Zavala&#39;s strength ended and anxiety began. That was where Variks needed to meet him and prove his worth.\n\n&quot;Vanguard Commander Zavala.&quot; Variks dropped to his knees and extended his hands palms up on the ground, sure to keep eye contact.

Desperation.\n\n&quot;On your feet, Variks.&quot; Zavala was quite used to giving commands and having them followed. Variks did as he was commanded. &quot;What do you want?&quot;\n\n&quot;A future for the Reef.&quot; Zavala eyes were searching.

He dropped the shovel, stared across the vacant town square at the smoldering ruin of the Diaz barn.\n\nEaton was dead. No point in keeping his secret any longer.\n\nHe crossed the distance at a speed and ease that would have shocked his neighbors and rounded a corner to find Judson, on the ground, leaning against the barn door. There was a cannon in Judson&#39;s hand, and his eyes opened wide when he recognized the man and his Ghost.\n\nJudson lifted the gun with a shaking fist. His other hand clutched a dark stain on his side.\n\n&quot;He&#39;s lost a lot of blood,&quot; Ghost said, its Light spilling across the scene.\n\n&quot;You were one &#39;a them all along,&quot; Judson sneered.\n\nThe man chuckled. &quot;All my lives, brother.&quot;\n\n&quot;You got us killed, you son of a&mdash;&quot;\n\nThe man kicked the firearm out of Judson&#39;s hand with no urgency at all.

I wanted to stop you from leaving, but I didn&#39;t think I had the right.&quot;\n\nJudson reached out to grab his throat. The man caught his hand in a vice-grip instead, a crushing handshake. Judson frowned and struggled, but he was exhausted. Dying.

His former friend managed a high-pitched wail, but couldn&#39;t break the man&#39;s grip, though he tried and tried.\n\nThe man nodded at Judson, addressing his Ghost. &quot;Do you see how he never gives up? Because he knows this one life is all he has? No fear.&quot;\n\n&quot;Those Risen out there?&quot; The man finished cauterizing the wound and used his suddenly-cool hand to wave indiscriminately into the darkening night. &quot;They&#39;d be long dead if they were him. All they know is war. This man survives.&quot;\n\nJudson made a gurgling sound. He had stopped struggling, but the man kept a grip on his hand.\n\n&quot;You wanted me to save him? Even if this works, he could never show me how to live. Not like he lives. And that&#39;s on you.&quot;\n\nGhost watched, but made minute adjustments to his orbiting armor and sent Light-based scans cascading across the ruins of town. If there were lingering Warlords or Iron Lords nearby, they would have to run.\n\nThe man stood up. Judson was dead.\n\n&quot;Maybe you should have told him you were bringing livestock in from a hundred leagues away and releasing them for him to catch,&quot; Ghost said.\n\n&quot;I mean&mdash;did you see how happy he was? How they all were? They got to eat,&quot; the man replied. &quot;Give someone something to chase and you give them purpose.&quot;\n\n&quot;You&#39;re pathetic. This is what you aspire to be?

Following the events of the Red War and the recent loss of the Hunter Vanguard, current acting Vanguard leadership has struggled to define its function and role within what is an otherwise largely egalitarian and self-governing body of active Guardians. Much like the current popular perception of the Awoken queen, we have failed to adequately respond to questions about our integrity, competence, and unity as we have grieved the loss of the Hunter Vanguard.\n\nThe Vanguard was never intended as a governing body of authoritarians, nor does it function as such, but in times of turmoil and uncertainty, people rightly look to figures of strength for guidance and support. Neither the Titan Vanguard nor I ever intended to become politicians. We are warriors, first and foremost, and we no longer feel that we are able to serve as such.\n\nIn the spirit of honest self-reflection in the face of justified skepticism, we have begun to discuss the possibility of stepping down to invite new leadership into our place, as well as the general merits of disbanding the Vanguard entirely&mdash;largely because we believe that this crisis of identity will plague anyone who steps into this role. We recognize that this is ill-timed, and we will endeavor to involve the Consensus, the Guardians themselves, and all other interested parties in the discussion as appropriate. I specifically invite the Hidden to closely monitor the situation without my involvement. Should you agree that we are doing more harm than good, please do not hesitate to take whatever actions you agree are necessary.\n\n2. Regarding the open Hunter Vanguard position and the terms of Cayde&#39;s Dare: The situation is unprecedented. Were we to trace the chain of culpability back to its first link, I believe we would be obligated to elect a Hive god to our council.\n\nOur current inclination is to caucus with the Hunters to debate the benefits of opening the position to any interested and well-qualified Hunter. Such a debate is, of course, contingent upon the continued existence of the Vanguard itself. We will make an effort to convene the Hunters as soon as possible, but this group should be well aware that most credible candidates have fled the Tower in anticipation of such a debate.\n\nMESSAGE ENDS", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "29940": {"title": "7.

But the Shadows were waiting for her.\n\nFrom a hidden vantage point on an overpass above, a single rocket from a shoulder-mounted launcher had obliterated the road in front of her. She&#39;d been thrown straight off her machine.\n\nIn that split second, she saw Bahaghari had tried to catch her in a beam of Light, but with a telltale whistle and snap, a restraining band had silenced her Ghost. She was falling by then.\n\nShe leaned into the roaring wind, transitioned her fall into a dive. The impact and temperature of the water shocked and chilled her to the bone as debris rained into the lake around her.\n\nShe started the long swim toward shore, toward a road she knew would take her to the overpass.\n\n**\n\nShe pulled up onto the overpass on a hijacked Pike and looked down at the smoldering wreckage of the bridge where she had fallen an hour ago.

It was consistent with the launch pattern of a shoulder-mounted Countess SA/2.\n\nShe patched it back to Drifter, and in return, he gave her the coordinates of three possible Shadow safehouses in the area. Without Bahaghari, she had to input them manually to her tracker HUD.\n\nShe selected the farthest one from her position and gunned the Pike.\n\n**\n\nBy the time she pulled up to an abandoned warehouse in District 125, the Shadows had already ransomed her Ghost on several City bands.

She has opened my mind to the consideration that my condition is a blessing rather than a curse. Time will tell.\n\nEntry 8\n\nOur peace was disrupted today by an assault from the warmongering Cabal at our doorstep. I was ushered to safety at the top of the spire by Leanna, one of our Warlock sisters. Without a moment&#39;s notice, she jumped straight into the fray and began to push our intruders back. During the battle, something strange occurred. Leanna was fighting near-insurmountable odds&mdash;based on the amount of ammunition I heard discharged&mdash;and she was overcome. Of course, she was resurrected by her Ghost, but the spire reacted. There was a hum; the timbre consisted of two distinct resonating tones&mdash;one smooth and warm, the other sharp and cold. I thought I could have imagined it through the ringing of gunfire, but it was most certainly there. It was almost imperceptible, and I thought merely a coincidence until it happened again. Eremac, the other Warlock and student of the Dawnblade, was also temporarily disposed of. The roar of the Colossus&#39;s slug launcher tearing through Eremac&#39;s flesh was unmistakable, but so was the tone that followed. I have to know more. We were able to withstand their incursion, but not without suffering a few casualties. Now we must prepare for a funeral, but my thoughts are dominated by that mysterious tone. Perhaps later, we can try to replicate it.\n\nEntry 12\n\nAfter explaining the phenomenon to Sister Faora, she has recruited the Warlocks to participate in thanatonautic death trials, in the hopes to recreate the hum and gain some clarity into its purpose. During these trials I had others accompany me to the top of the spire to see if they too could hear the tones. None were able to ascertain much&mdash;it seems one would need to be musically inclined or have some training&mdash;and the weight has fallen on me to decipher the code. I can&#39;t be sure of the intent, but I am certain of the cause. Every time one of our Warlocks sacrificed themselves, that same resonance would reverberate through my ears. What does it mean, and what purpose does it serve? Is the spire, in fact, an instrument?

Sure, the Vanguard and your other allies, old and new, were around to aid you, but as always you forged a trail all your own, ever true to yourself, ever strong and defiant against the endless tide that threatens us all.\n\nYour consistent heroism and ability to adapt your skills and aggression to face ever-evolving trials prove you worthy of my confidence. This is why I shared my truths with you&mdash;my journey, the Shadows, our purpose, our sins. When you sought Thorn, the hated yin to the Word&#39;s noble yang, I knew you were headed in a fateful direction that would see me and mine as nothing more than afterthoughts in the wars to come. That I may have served as a catalyst for even a sliver of your continued growth is an honor. All of my faith says you will be a linchpin in the building of a new world, one where absolutes cower to the might of compromise, where Light tempers dark and the dark opens new insight into the Light&#39;s many undiscovered gifts.\n\nFrom this moment on, my closest allies and I will be gone. Our job is done. And, despite appearances, our purest intent was never as simple and mundane as to rile and endanger, though such tactics were needed. No, our task was always to find those, like yourself, who could further the meaning of what it means to be a Guardian and to push you forward in ways never before considered or allowed.\n\nPart of me worries that you will hold some level of contempt for the manner in which I have chosen to work. The Vanguard certainly do, and they do not endorse it, though they abide it. They don&#39;t know everything the Shadows and I have done. It is better that they do not.\n\nBut know this&mdash;as clearly as you know anything&mdash;the means justify the ends and there is no part of me that regrets the choices I&#39;ve made. The circumstances that have led us all here? Yes. There is a pain at the very heart of me that any of us must exist in this terrible world we have, in part crafted for ourselves, but know above all things: It is our enemies, those who have come from out of the black to hinder our every advance, who deserve our ire. They are wicked, and they are boundless in their villainy. I speak not only of the Hive or the Fallen, the Vex or the Cabal. There are enemies at every turn&mdash;including a small but growing faction of the champions you call brothers and sisters.\n\nBe ever-mindful of the selfish and ill-prepared.

I am trying to chronicle trillions of star systems at once, searching for a single planet.

The descent gets warmer and warmer until all goes black, and I awake.\n\nSONGS OF ANALYSIS: I am outside my body watching it float from one shapeless void into another. The first void contains a voice humming a tune, yet no presence. As I pass through each, one by one, another voice joins in harmony. I try counting the voices, but I am not sure if I should be adding or subtracting as they fade into one, and in my confusion I lose any memory of numbers at all. I feel a tether pulling me back into being and see myself waving goodbye. A voice burrows into my mind as the serenading songs become discordant, ugly. The voice becomes louder, and I awake.\n\nWASHING SKIN: I have gathered my belongings in a gray porcelain sink. The soap clings to my fingers. As I wash what I possess, my things begin to dissolve.

He even designed some of Rasputin&#39;s hardware!\n\nI hope he shows me what he&#39;s working on.

I don&#39;t really get what he&#39;d even do for BrayTech. All he does is ask people how they&#39;re feeling over and over again. Maybe they need him to train a Warmind like Dr. Ana Bray did. Only instead of language, he&#39;ll teach it how to analyze its dreams.\n\nDad always teases Papa that a human brain is a lot harder to work with than a hard drive. Maybe Papa got him on one of his projects to finally prove him wrong.\n\nWhat do you have: a hard drive or a brain? Are you an AI like Rasputin? Have you ever talked to him?\n\nSorry if these questions are nosy. Dad says I&#39;m super curious and that&#39;s okay, I just need to learn when to stop asking questions. Which is pretty unfair since he gets to ask me stuff all the time. Like right now, he asked what I&#39;m writing.

Upon the Leviathan, wandering at our Emperor&#39;s whim. Today I fill the Y-goblet with dice, so that my ancestors may roll the odds. My every thought and purpose for my Emperor, Calus, once and future sovereign.\n\nI was in the observatory today when he came to me. I should have been vetting a list of loyalists for the countercoup, but in truth, I was watching the ruined mirrors of an ancient starshell as they plummeted four hundred million kilometers into a blue sun. They look like crumpled handkerchiefs. Their fall is very slow, and those who made them are eons dead.\n\nHere on our Leviathan, all is reborn. The guard companies have buffed their armor to a syrupy shine. The ship responds ably to our commands, and we can barely quench its appetite for mass to feed its engines and factories. Music fills the gardens, the gardeners hum along as they trim and weed, and Calus dallies in the kitchens with a pinch of spice, once more unmistakably himself.\n\nI haven&#39;t thought into this journal since that day at the edge, when Calus came out of his observation bubble overflowing with joy. &quot;It&#39;s the end,&quot; he bellowed, giddy as a girl with her first tusks. &quot;It&#39;s magnificent, it&#39;s divine, it&#39;s more than I ever was!

That day frightened all of us&mdash;none of us will speak of it, and we do not dare more than the shallowest metaconcert, lest our memories pool into a deadly truth. But in that void, Calus saw his purpose renewed. He guided us to reset the failed navigation system, repair the traitors&#39; sabotage, and retake control. I thought we would hurry back to the homeworld, but Calus no longer seems to pine for his lost throne... or to care at all about the reforms he once championed.\n\nNow we wander the galaxy on an epicurean crusade, sampling a bounty of raw furies and rare delights. All the inquisitiveness and avarice that Calus once poured into government he now extends to his appetites. I have seen Calus feast on things no living mouth can eat.

Or a pea of neutronium that should have torn through him like fog. He told me it tasted like the thickest fudge.\n\nHe is changing.\n\nHe was here a moment ago. The ruined starshell caught his attention: He loves beauty, and millions of mirror-bright sails folding up like tissues in wind to fall into a blue giant are very beautiful.

They did not travel through time or lacerate the universe and crawl into the wounds or yearn for the patronage of any old machine... they were creatures of material ambition, of physics, of life.

We are maintaining our containment posture at Cocytus. I assess no immediate danger to the system, and we have enough firepower to destroy the station and its mechanisms remotely if the on-site warheads fail. The station remains in the stable heliocentric orbit where it was parked after the destruction of Ceres.\n\n2. I do not ask confirmation of these theories, and in fact I beg you not to address them. But I have reviewed the site records, and the fate of the Sophia&#39;s crew after they were herded to Cocytus stinks of Hive madness. The Cocytus apertures must&mdash;at the time&mdash;have opened into a Hive manifold associated with Crota. Whatever their original purpose, when Crota established his presence in the system, they became conduits into hell... and the Sophia crew&#39;s ugly end proved it. Whoever drove the Sophia to its doom then installed the Cocytus Instruments around the original Golden Age facility to study Crota&#39;s manifold.\n\n3. Crota is dead. His hold on these gates has passed. Now something else is trying to pass through into our world... but it is so alien, and its sendings so bafflingly malformed, that I fear this can only end in madness.\n\n4. The first &quot;visitors&quot; through the third gate, at event time 00:00:00, were simple hydrogen atoms. Over the course of 72 hours, the emissions developed from diatomic hydrogen to nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, water, and simple organic molecules. At the 80-hour mark, we received our first macroscopic visitor, a pellet of thick black hydrocarbon tar. Until 82:34:15 the gate vomited tar containing increasingly complex monomers and polymers.\n\n5. The visitors then began to assume geometric form. A hail of cubes and hexagons, each built from molecular crystal of the same form as the whole. A series of fractal shapes that shattered under internal flaws. Several capsules or membranes of increasingly complex structure, containing water or oil. These may have been cellular precursors.\n\n6. At 524:03:11 a living organism appeared. Death was immediate. Remote dissection describes a spherical body, radius approximately one meter, surfaced in thick hydrocarbon tar. Deep, evenly spaced &quot;throats&quot; converged on a central cavity perhaps intended to serve as lung and stomach. The body exhibited undifferentiated tissue of primitive plantlike cells, capable of spasming to pump air or fluid in and out of the throats. Without enzymes to catalyze metabolism, or internal structure to dispose of waste, the organism could not survive. Cell death occurred almost instantaneously throughout the mass. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n7. At 690:29:54 the gate emitted a tubular organism. For ninety seconds the organism moved across the gate chamber by contracting and expanding, then expired. Remote dissection describes a two-meter-long body with a spinal cavity full of energy-rich carbohydrate fluid. The organism&#39;s contractions forced this fluid through a capillary network, where simple cells catabolized the carbohydrates into energy to power further contractions. The buildup of heat and waste quickly denatured the enzymes required for metabolism, and the organism died. There were no provisions for self-repair or reproduction.\n\n8. The gate has remained inactive since, barring short emissions of molecules which may be experimental proteins. Remote drones have registered similar ambient molecules within the Hellmouth on Luna, though we have been unable to identify their source. We will maintain the quarantine until otherwise instructed.\n\nThe overwhelming impression I have is one of learning, of increasing sophistication in the synthesis and arrangement of matter. The atoms in these structures were isotopically pure and impossible to date, but I have the uncomfortable sense that even they were freshly made.\n\n9. Probes and instruments dispatched through the third gate do not return. Annihilation is apparently immediate, and so total that it seems to result from a fundamental failure of the ability to exist rather than any weapon or countermeasure. Yet something does exist on the far side, and it is trying to learn the rules of our world from very first principles.

Maybe the Shadows want to actively recruit. They&#39;ve tried and failed in the past to put the use of Darkness into Guardian arsenals.\n\nBut the Drifter and the Shadows could be at odds. The man is a loner and a cheat, building as many bridges as he burns in the Guardian community. He has true allegiance to nothing and no one but himself. It&#39;s possible he&#39;s gathering Gambit regulars to defend himself from his own kind.\n\nOr the Dredgens are here to help their ally, the Drifter, with the operation of Gambit or some new, unknown goal.\n\nI share all this with you hoping for your confidence. The Drifter is not to be trusted. Involve yourself with him and the Dredgens at your own risk.

In the original, Thetis held Achilles in the fire to burn his weakness away. His father Peleus, terrified by the sight of his child in the flame, interrupted the ritual. The father&#39;s cowardice doomed the son. We must be brave as Thetis, and hold our children in the fire. We must fight on.\n\n1.

Victory is the preservation of Good Life, which is the Life which promotes Life other than itself. Guardians are immortal and thus the end of existence is within their shrievalty. Ultimate victory for Guardians must lie in the preservation of Good Life until the end of time.\n\n5. What is the value of secrets in attaining victory? Simply thus: All life is reducible to information. The difference between a cloud of atoms and a Human being is in the arrangement of those atoms, which is information. You prove this every time you use your transmat, which destroys your physical form but preserves the information encoded in it. All the qualities of a person, a species, or a galactic civilization may be stored as information.\n\n6. What do we call information that is safe? We call it a secret.

He doesn&#39;t really come and go as you or I might traditionally think. It&#39;s more that you turn around, and he is either there or he is not. His appearances are steady and predictable, at least. He&#39;s called X&ucirc;r. I&#39;m not sure why one draws the tiny arrow over his name, but it&#39;s important to try and respect the wishes of those we don&#39;t understand.\n\nThe first time I ever saw X&ucirc;r, I was by myself at my stall in the Tower. The Old Tower, I suppose you&#39;d call it now. I hadn&#39;t been there long at all. I looked up, and this man had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere! His back was to me, but even from behind, something seemed off about him. Something in his posture. As he started to turn, I noticed his whole face appeared to be covered in hair. It even seemed to be moving, gently flowing on its own&mdash;but there was no wind.\n\nWhen the light hit his face, I screamed and ducked down behind part of my cabinets. I was sure this abomination had come to invade us, that more of them were just out of sight, that we were done for.\n\nEventually, I realized no one else was screaming. I heard no sounds of distress. I peeked out and saw that everyone was going about their business. No one was panicking but me! Many people saw him&mdash;several were interacting with him.\n\nSlowly, I stood back up and tried to go about my business&mdash;though I rarely looked away. Tess came over before too long, and I asked her about the strange figure.\n\n&quot;Oh, that&#39;s X&ucirc;r!&quot; she said, unconcerned. &quot;He comes through every so often and sells particular, hard-to-find things.&quot; She considered him for a moment, then added, &quot;Could do with a bit of a wardrobe update, if you ask me, but he&#39;s otherwise harmless.&quot;\n\n&quot;What is he?&quot; I asked. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a creature like that before.&quot;\n\n&quot;X&ucirc;r is&hellip; I believe he&#39;s called a Jovian.

I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d call X&ucirc;r friendly, but he&#39;s not hostile.&quot;\n\nI felt more at ease after our conversation, though I still could not shake my fear. For many months, I jumped every time I saw him and had to fight back the instinct to hide.\n\nEventually, I grew used to his presence. I even began to appreciate his predictability&mdash;it became a symbol that everything was functioning as it should. The fear evaporated with time.\n\nI have often found that my first reaction to new things is fear. Perhaps it is this way for everyone. However, I have also found that if I accept and acknowledge my fear, it is easier to push through until I am no longer afraid.

I missed my friends while I was away, and I thought about them every day. Even when you&#39;re doing what you know is right, it can be hard not to wish for times past.\n\nI&#39;ve wanted so much to catch up on everything I missed, but these Guardians are so busy, always flitting in and out. You can barely get a word out of them most of the time. I feel like so much has happened, but I get only drips of information.\n\n&quot;Spider&quot; is a name I hear over and over, but who is he? A common criminal? A deity? A friend? Some accounts paint him as all three. What is it about this Spider fellow that compels these Guardians so?\n\nAnd do I have it right that he feeds on Ghosts? Ghosts! What an utterly despicable practice. Even the most detestable Ghost doesn&#39;t deserve that kind of treatment. (Yes, I am thinking of one in particular, but&hellip; I&#39;m afraid old Eva will keep that secret to herself.)\n\nFrom what I can put together, this Spider fellow had a group of Barons, I think. If that&#39;s correct, his relationship with them seemed&hellip; tenuous. I don&#39;t know what one gets up to on this Tangled Shore, but I think he had them all killed.\n\nBefore that, though, Spider&#39;s Barons broke into some kind of high-security prison out in space. They were looking for&hellip; something belonging to Spider. I don&#39;t know what it was. Maybe it was Ghosts or maybe it was weapons&mdash;although why he&#39;d have someone look for those things in a prison, I don&#39;t know. While his Barons were in there, the prisoners started to fight them. That rascal Cayde-6 was also in the prison, on a mission that I don&#39;t think was related to Spider&#39;s mission. They ended up in the same fight, though, from what it sounds like. Then, while everyone was fighting, the Reef Queen&#39;s brother arrived!\n\nWhen I first heard this story, at this point I thought to myself, &quot;Oh, good! Finally someone on our side. The Awoken Prince will help get things in order.&quot; Now, keep in mind that I had always heard he was&hellip; a bit stiff. But also that he was willing to help when it came down to it. That was before his sister, though. Loss can do terrible, ugly things to us.\n\nThis leads me to the only detail I know with absolute certainty: Uldren Sov killed Cayde-6.\n\nI don&#39;t know why, but I suspect it was in part because the Prince succumbed to the pain in his heart and lost the ability to see things as they are. Anyway, once Spider&#39;s Barons left the prison, they ran all over the Reef. I guess they had found what Spider was looking for, but decided to keep those things for themselves. This Spider sent people after the Barons, and I don&#39;t think any of the Barons survived.\n\nWhile all this was going on, someone killed Uldren. I assume it was revenge for Cayde, but I can&#39;t get anyone to tell me with certainty who did it. Based on everything else I hear about this Spider, I wonder if Uldren wasn&#39;t also his work.\n\nMany of my Guardian friends are still doing favors for this&hellip; creature who, at best, betrays his own people. I am not sure that road leads anywhere good. Though perhaps I don&#39;t have the whole truth.\n\nThis is no history lesson. Take it however you will.

It has whispered into my ear, and I am enlightened. Death is coming, and It has made me Its herald.

And out of the Nothing, there came whispering in a dark language, which filled his head so loud that he forgot for a moment his own language, and suddenly the Nothingness dispersed to show Something, which was a fleet of foreign ships. He saw next the destruction of a great many worlds and creatures, including all his enemies, and himself, and he saw the rot and fragmentation of his own corpse and skeleton.

Suraya Hawthorne is one of those people. I know her brusque attitude can be off-putting, and that&#39;s intentional on her part. But once you get past that, there is so much to learn.\n\nShe was orphaned as a young girl, and Devrim and Marc took her in. Honestly, I think having these two as role models is part of why she&#39;s as strong as she is. They raised her to be sure of herself and to always do what she thought was right&hellip; even though that ultimately led to her having to leave the City.\n\nAs Suraya tells it, she came home one day to find Marc and Devrim sitting at the kitchen table, as though expecting her. They had her sit down, then asked if there was anything she wanted to tell them.\n\nShe shook her head. &quot;Nope.&quot;\n\nMarc asked her to try again, but she was silent, so he told her that Executor Hideo had stopped by their home. She asked how he was.\n\n&quot;You know how he is,&quot; Devrim said. &quot;Tell us what happened.&quot;\n\n&quot;His face got in the way.&quot;\n\nMarc took a deep breath and said Hideo claimed to have caught her stealing supplies that morning, and did she have anything to say about that? She did not.\n\nHe reminded her that stealing supplies and breaking a faction leader&#39;s nose were both good ways to get kicked out of the City, and Suraya could keep quiet no longer. She almost shouted her explanation: The factions didn&#39;t care about the people who needed food and supplies&mdash;the people who could not pledge to a faction because they were too busy struggling to survive. She wanted to help them, so she would sometimes steal supplies from New Monarchy.\n\nDevrim asked, &quot;What about Hideo?&quot;\n\nSuraya rolled her eyes and groaned, explained that when Hideo had found her, he&#39;d said all manner of nasty, evil things to her: She was worthless, she was nothing, things like that.\n\nDevrim agreed Hideo was&hellip; well, I won&#39;t repeat it, but suffice to say it means &quot;an unpleasant person.&quot; He held a lot of influence, though, and he was insisting Suraya be punished. Harshly. For Suraya&#39;s part, this seemed to crystallize something. She tells me that&#39;s the first time she knew she wanted to leave the City&mdash;that perhaps this had been part of why she&#39;d punched Hideo. She told her guardians and they couldn&#39;t believe it.\n\nThey were quiet for a bit. Then Devrim broke the silence. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get packed.&quot;\n\n&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Absolutely not.&quot; She was not about to let her decisions hurt these men who had taken her in and cared for her. They&#39;d done nothing wrong.\n\nOh, they fought her. As she tells it, they argued a long time, until finally, she shrugged and said, &quot;If you try to come with me, I&#39;ll run away.&quot;\n\nShe suspected they knew there was no bluff to call, as they spoke now in tired, worried voices, making their case one last time. Suraya was adamant. &quot;I won&#39;t let you suffer for my choices.&quot; What could they do?\n\nShe asked when she had to leave. Marc said he could hold off Hideo for a day or two so they could all make a plan. His voice became stern again, and he said, &quot;You&#39;re going somewhere close enough that we can come and check on you as often as we like. At least for a while. That is nonnegotiable.&quot;\n\nHe had no negotiating power, of course. But Suraya had agreed. She stayed very near the City for over a year before saying proper goodbyes and heading out further into the world.\n\nSuraya Hawthorne is, in my mind, the definition of doing what you think is right regardless of the consequences. She knew it was right to help struggling families, she knew it was right to not put Devrim and Marc in harm&#39;s way, and she knew it was right to give them some peace of mind by staying close. That is the kind of true courage I have always admired.\n\n---\n\nEliksni Birdseed:\nMix Ether Cane and Personal Touch, add Essence of Dawning, then bake.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "30030": {"title": "The Good Fight", "text": "&quot;Abuela? Ma&#39;am?&quot;\n\nIt was quiet, almost a whisper, but enough to wake Eva. For a spinning, disorienting moment, she thought she was sitting in her living room back in Peregrine district. Her favorite afghan over the end of the couch and Carlos standing over her&hellip; but that wasn&#39;t Carlos.\n\nThe concerned face of the Hunter, Ramos, looked down at her. More than a few of the Guardians that went through the Underground had taken to calling her grandmother, but Ramos had stuck with the group through all the long months of the war.\n\nHe was very protective, sometimes smothering, and she sighed as she rubbed at her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m up. I&#39;m up. What time is it?&quot; She sat up on the old couch she&#39;d been sleeping on, wincing as she tried to sort the knots she&#39;d developed sleeping on her side.\n\n&quot;Almost 0700?&quot; His voice was low and a little sheepish.\n\nShe glared at him. &quot;You were supposed to wake me an hour ago.&quot;\n\nHis grin was lopsided. &quot;You needed the sleep.&quot;\n\nShe stood carefully and tottered on unsteady legs, turning her face away so he couldn&#39;t see her annoyance. &quot;Are they waiting?&quot;\n\n&quot;They&#39;ve only just arrived. One of the reasons I waited. They&#39;re not expecting you for another 10 minutes.&quot; Trying to justify himself.\n\nEva sighed again. &quot;Thank you, Ramos. You&#39;re right; I did need the sleep. I was up again too late last night. Go tell them I&#39;ll be right down.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; He sounded happier, and his footfalls as he left the room were light, confident.\n\nEva stepped into the bathroom off the main living quarters of this second-floor flat. Her morning routine sorted, she poured some water out of one of the ration canisters into the stoppered-up sink so she could wash, try to feel a little less like she&#39;d slept on a half-rotten couch in an abandoned building.\n\nWater dripping down her nose, she reached blindly for one of the pieces of scrap cloth they used for towels and dried her face. When her eyes cleared, she found herself looking at a stranger.\n\nEva had always been on the thin side. She could still remember her mother chiding her, telling her to eat and clean her plate. Now the woman staring back at her was positively gaunt. Bags under her eyes, hair chopped brutally short, and her clothes! The clothes she&#39;d been wearing the day of the attack hadn&#39;t lasted two weeks, never intended for living rough. The homespun outfit she&#39;d stitched for herself would never have passed muster back at the Tower, but&hellip; out here they had to do. At least she&#39;d been able to salvage her trademark shawl. Something to remind her of better days&hellip;\n\nAs she drifted into the living room, Eva reflected that better days, of course, were why the group was gathered downstairs. All of the Underground cell leaders gathered in one place for an important&mdash;perhaps final&mdash;conversation.\n\nFor the Underground, the Red War was a stunning victory. They&#39;d won. The only civilians and Guardians left in the City were those unwilling or unable to go. Eva frowned, saddened.\n\nEvery few weeks they heard stories of a group of Guardians overrun from a supposedly secure bunker by a Legion assault. The loss of civilian life had been staggering, both in the initial assault and the intervening months.\n\nAs she looked down into the street through a slit around the boarded-up window, she had to admit to a feeling of&hellip; satisfaction. Now all that was left was for the Underground itself to pull out, make for the Farm and the safety-in-numbers of Hawthorne&#39;s group. Eva raised her eyes from the empty streets to the distant sight of the Tower, twisted and ruined.\n\nShe would stay, she had decided. Guardians like Ramos could check on her from time to time, but someone needed to stay behind and keep the lights on. There could be refugees still alive out there. Still hoping for a way&hellip; out.\n\nShe turned away from the window to head downstairs when the explosion ripped through the street in front of the apartment, and Eva&#39;s world turned white.", "authors": "Unknown [ Destiny ] "}, "30031": {"title": "King&#39;s Wrath", "text": "Dinna twists the emergency transponder until the circuit closes.

Fingers off triggers, weapons skewed a few degrees off target&mdash;\n\nThe impulse is so strong because it jives with Dinna&#39;s discipline, which has already stepped in to crush the immediate instinct to blow Uldren away. Something&#39;s wrong. Something&#39;s off.\n\nBaseline Humans can react to a visual stimulus in less than two hundred milliseconds. Awoken, less than a hundred. But there is a phenomenon Dinna and every other Royal Guard knows well, a trick of the mind called attentional blink. You are waiting for something to appear: a hostile, a gunshot, a loud noise. When it does appear, your attention blinks. You cannot detect a second event if it comes just after the first.\n\nSo it is with the blue flash of Arc-rifle fire behind Uldren&#39;s cloak.\n\nIt could go differently, still.
