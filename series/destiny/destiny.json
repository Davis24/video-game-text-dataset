Some adherents believe that this armada sprang from species rejected or discarded by the Traveler for their sins.\n\nUlan-Tan&#39;s Thesis considers the Darkness a necessary symmetry to the Traveler in a cosmic balance. In this view, the Traveler&#39;s goodness led it to sacrifice for others, and it is up to us to return this goodness by healing the Traveler.\n\nThe Monist Position, or the Deflationary Position, considers the Darkness as a technologically sophisticated force, perhaps a post-Singularity intelligence. Adherents invoke information theory or contend that the universe is a simulation, allowing advanced intelligence to gain weakly acausal powers by bending the rules.\n\nThe Acataleptic Clause claims that we are intrinsically unable to understand the Darkness. In many respects this belief parallels the Praxic Creed, which suggests that we should stop worrying about the nature of the Darkness and focus on resisting and defeating it.\n\nCertain positions - often labeled heretical - imply that the Traveler itself triggered the Collapse, or that it knew the Darkness was coming for it and hoped to use the Solar System as a sacrifice or a proxy army.

Elegant like a knife point. It explains - this is not hyperbole, this is the farthest thing from exaggeration - EVERYTHING.\n\nBut you lay it out and they stare at you like you&#39;ve just been exhaling dust. Maybe they&#39;re missing some underlying scaffold of truth. Maybe they are all propped on a bed of lies that must be burned away.\n\nWhy does anything exist?\n\nNo no no no no don&#39;t reach for that word. There&#39;s no &#39;reason&#39;. That&#39;s teleology and teleology will stitch your eyelids shut.\n\nWhy do we have atoms? Because atomic matter is more stable than the primordial broth. Atoms defeated the broth. That was the first war. There were two ways to be and one of them won. And everything that came next was made of atoms.\n\nAtoms made stars. Stars made galaxies. Worlds simmered down to rock and acid and in those smoking primal seas the first living molecule learned to copy itself. All of this happened by the one law, the blind law, which exists without mind or meaning. It&#39;s the simplest law but it has no worshippers here (out there, though, out there - !)\n\nHOW DO I EXPLAIN IT it&#39;s so simple WHY DON&#39;T YOU SEE\n\nImagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.\n\nThe future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.\n\nThis explains everything, understand? This is why the universe is the way it is, and not some other way. Existence is a game that everything plays, and some strategies are winners: the ability to exist, to shape existence, to remake it so that your descendants - molecules or stars or people or ideas - will flourish, and others will find no ground to grow.\n\nAnd as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.\n\nEverything is becoming more ruthless and in the end only the most ruthless will remain (LOOK UP AT THE SKY) and they will hunt the territories of the night and extinguish the first glint of competition before it can even understand what it faces or why it has transgressed. This is the shape of victory: to rule the universe so absolutely that nothing will ever exist except by your consent. This is the queen at the end of time, whose sovereignty is eternal because no other sovereign can defeat it. And there is no reason for it, no more than there was reason for the victory of the atom. It is simply the winning play.\n\nOf course, it might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.\n\nBut I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies.

It represents many hundreds of failed operations.\n\nGuardian activity in the Freehold AO has exploded across recent campaign seasons. Tactical attrition exceeds both frictional projections and our ability to regenerate losses. New tactics are necessary.\n\nThe primary threat is the Guardians&rsquo; individual counter-attrition capability.\n\nGuardians can be rebuilt after even total disintegrative trauma. This capability is provided by a small autonomous drone unit called a Dead Person [trans. unclear]. The Dead Person conceals itself during combat. It is not a viable target for direct fire. Saturation attack by artillery/heavy air/orbital fire may have good effect (although Guardians transmat frequently and refuse to assemble into large formations).\n\nSolitary Dead Persons have been observed in all areas of operation. The relationship between solitary and paired Dead Persons remains unclear.\n\nPsion analysis indicates that specific areas are inimicable to Guardian counter-attritional reconstruction. Phobos Command has initiated an orbital survey. BL I/2 will attack the Vex gate artifact in Meridian Bay to secure possible related intelligence.\n\nFlayer analysis suggests that the Hive have developed unconventional counter-Dead Person capability.

No human being in the Ishtar Academy has ever crossed the safety cordon and walked the ancient stone under the Citadel, the Vex construct that stabs up out of the world to injure space and time. It&#39;s not safe. The cellular Vex elements are infectious, hallucinogenic, entheogenic. The informational Vex elements are more dangerous yet&mdash; and there could be semiotic hazards beyond them, aggressive ideas, Vex who exist without a substrate. Even now, operating remote bodies by neural link, the team&#39;s thoughts are relayed through the warmind who saved them, sandboxed and scrubbed for hazards. Their real bodies are safe in the Academy, protected by distance and neural firewall.\n\nBut they walk together in proxy, pressed close, huddled in awe. Blue-green light, light the color of an ancient sea, washes over them. Each of their explorer bodies carries a slim computer. Inside, two hundred twenty-seven of copies of their own minds wait, patient and paused, for dispersal.\n\n&quot;I wonder where it came from,&quot; Duane-Mcniadh says. Of course he&#39;s the one to break the reverent silence. &quot;The Citadel. I wonder if it was here before the Traveler changed Venus.&quot;\n\n&quot;It could have been latent,&quot; Chioma Esi suggests. She&#39;s the leader. She kept them together when it seemed like they faced actual, eternal torture. She pulled them through. &quot;Seeded in the crust. Waiting for a period of geological quiescence, so it could grow.&quot;\n\nDr. Shim shrugs. &quot;I think the Traveler did something paracausal to Venus. Something that cut across space and time. The Citadel seems to come from the past of a different Venus than our own. It doesn&#39;t have to make any sense by our logic, any more than the Moon&#39;s new gravity.&quot;\n\nMaya Sundaresh walks at the center of the group. She&#39;s been too quiet lately. What happened to them wasn&#39;t her fault and maybe she&#39;ll believe that soon. &quot;What could you do with it?&quot; she murmurs, staring up. &quot;If you understood it?&quot;\n\nChioma puts an arm around her. &quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to find out. Where the Citadel can send us. Whether we can come back.&quot;\n\n&quot;They&#39;re not us any more.&quot; Maya looks down at herself, at the cache of her self-forks. &quot;We&#39;re not going anywhere. We&#39;re sending them. They&#39;re diverging.&quot;\n\nThey rescued themselves from the inside of a Vex mind, two hundred and twenty-seven copies of themselves, untortured and undamaged. Those copies voted, all unanimously, to be dispatched into the Vex information network as explorers.\n\nWhen Maya and Chioma look at each other they can tell they&#39;re each wondering the same thing: how many of them will stay together, wherever they go? How many fork-Mayas and fork-Chiomas will fall out of love? How many will end up bereft, grieving? How many will be happy, like them?\n\nChioma tries a little smile. Maya smiles back, haltingly, and then, sighing, unable to stop herself, grins a big stupid grin, an everything-is-okay grin. Shim makes a loud obnoxious awwww at them. Duane-McNiadh is still thinking about paracausality, and doesn&#39;t notice.\n\nThey climb. When they find the Vex aperture they plan to use, they overlay the luminous stone and ancient brassy machines with images of sun and sand. They set up the transmitters and interfaces that will translate two hundred and twenty-seven simulations of the four of them into Vex language, into the tangled pathways of the Vex network, to see what&#39;s out there, and maybe come home.\n\nIn the metaphor they&#39;ve chosen, setting up the equipment is like laying out the picnic. In the metaphor they&#39;ve chosen they look like themselves, not hardened explorer proxies. Like people.\n\n&quot;Do you think,&quot; Duane-McNiadh begins, halting, &quot;that you could use this place to change things? If you regretted something, could you find a way through the Citadel, go back, and change it?&quot;\n\n&quot;I wish I could go back and change you into someone else,&quot; Dr. Shim grouses. Chioma&#39;s shaking her head. She knows physics. &quot;Time is self-consistent,&quot; she says. &quot;I think it&#39;s like the story of the merchant and the alchemist. You could go back and watch something, or be part of something, but if you did, then that was the way it always happened.&quot;\n\n&quot;Maybe you could bring something back to now. Something you needed.&quot; Maya runs a hand across the surface of the Vex aperture, feeling it with sensors ten thousand times as precise as a human hand. These proxy bodies are limited&mdash; they crash and need resetting every few hours, they struggle with latency, they can&#39;t hold much long term memory. But they&#39;ll get better. &quot;Or go forward and learn something vital. If you knew how to control it, how to navigate across space and time.&quot;\n\n&quot;So it&#39;s just a way to make everything more complicated.&quot; Duane-McNiadh sighs. &quot;It doesn&#39;t fix anything. Nothing ever does! I should&#39;ve taken that job at&mdash; &quot;\n\n&quot;You would&#39;ve hated it at Clovis,&quot; Dr. Shim says. &quot;We both know you&#39;re happier here.&quot; Duane-McNiadh stands stunned by this courtesy, and then they both pretend to ignore each other.\n\nThe four of them set up the interface. Their stored copies wake up and prepare for the journey, so that as they work they find themselves surrounded by the mental phantasms of themselves: two hundred and twenty-seven Mayas and Chiomas knocking helmets and smiling, two hundred and twenty-seven Dr. Shims making cynical bets with each other about how long they&#39;ll last, two hundred and twenty-seven Duane-McNiadhs blowing goodbye kisses to the sweet golden sun, two hundred and twenty-seven of them shaking hands, smiling, making ready to explore.", "authors": ["Unknown [ Destiny ] "]}, {"id": "29082", "title": "Ghost Fragment: Hive", "text": "We were overwhelmed.

We didn&#39;t, you know, do anything actively - no handshake, no icy stare of grudging mutual respect. I don&#39;t even know which hand you would shake. Do they shake hands? It must be complicated.\n\nAnyway, it was like this. I was on the Moon. I cracked a Hive structure near Mare Imbrium, looking for a Shrine, and they just - swarmed. Ranks and ranks and ranks of Thrall, pouring out between the columns, but the columns were Knights, and all the shadows behind them rose up hissing sorcery.\n\nOf course I ran.\n\nI had a line of egress and while yes it was full of Thrall I had a backup too. I went upslope. Took cover in the shadow of a crashed Phaeton. Emptied my machine gun, ducked down to reload, and saw her at the other end of the hull, killing Thrall: a Fallen in Exile colors, bannered in the marks of a Baron, though the flags were claw-torn and stained with Hive ash. She was alone. I think she must have lost her crew.\n\nI didn&#39;t really have time to shoot her and she didn&#39;t really have time to shoot me so we just went back to killing Hive. Knights pushed me out into the open and back up the range to a high stone saddle in the shadow of an old interferometry array. It was good ground so she came up there too.\n\nFor a while we just killed things which is hard to make interesting in a story so I&#39;ll pass it over.\n\nAt the end the Wizards came. I climbed the array to get an angle on them and she fell back to the base of the antennae where she broke her swords off in a Knight. I saw that happen and I don&#39;t know if I can tell you how I felt. She was another living thing with a mind I could understand and she hadn&#39;t howled at me or tried to eat my Ghost. I cheered when the Knight went down.\n\nWhen I came down, empty on all guns, she was slumped against a bulkhead staring at me with all her tiny black eyes. Ether leaking out of her like smoke. The Knight hadn&#39;t died easily. Downslope the last Wizard moved like fire behind another line of Thrall.\n\nI looked at her and wondered how many innocent human lives she&#39;d ended on those broken blades.\n\nShe did the strangest thing then. Took the last shock pistol from her bandolier and threw it between us, as if to offer it. When I went to pick it up she tried to knife me, but she was slow, and when I broke her arms and opened her throat she didn&#39;t seem surprised.\n\nTo this day I wonder if she hated me, or wanted to make me kill her, or just felt she should spare me the choice.\n\nI did kill a few Thrall with that pistol.", "authors": ["Unknown [ Destiny ] "]}, {"id": "29097", "title": "House of Exile", "text": "&quot;They live among the Hive.

A writhing mob of children spread across it, clusters of them barreling into each other as they bellowed and screamed. A much smaller number of elders waded in the chaotic sea of miniature people.\n\n&ldquo;What is this? What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Shaxx demanded.\n\n&ldquo;This City has children. Children who must stay within designated safe zones.&rdquo; The two Guardians watched as a boy climbed the largest rock on the field, about four feet in the air, and howled at the sky. &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re gonna go a little stir-crazy. Parents bring them out to this&mdash;you&rsquo;d think it would have a name&mdash;this field every month, and they have at it. Better they hit each other than climb the walls.&rdquo;\n\nShaxx stared at them.\n\n&ldquo;So.

You&rsquo;ll pick a team of two, and you&rsquo;re going to train them in this... sport they play here. It&rsquo;s some kind of tournament.

Get comfy.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I can pay you Glimmer. Two Crucible matches&rsquo; worth. Why waste my time on children?&rdquo;\n\nA child sped past and waved at Cayde as Shaxx spoke.

He quickly discerned the two on the field with the best athletic potential. Two human girls, snarling as they swung branches at each other, seemingly impervious to pain. He walked past them, through the crowd, and several elders paused just briefly enough in their youth wrangling to let their jaws hang. Lord Shaxx navigated the unruly sea with grace, and headed toward a lone tree in a corner of the field. An Awoken girl and a human boy sat huddled below it.\n\nAs Shaxx&rsquo;s shadow eclipsed them, they looked up at him with the same brightness in their eyes. &ldquo;What are your names?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Runa,&rdquo; said the Awoken with some disdain. She returned the blank stare of Shaxx&rsquo;s faceplate. &ldquo;My name is Lonwabo,&rdquo; recited the human, more like a question than a statement.\n\n&ldquo;You look bored, Runa,&rdquo; Shaxx observed. &ldquo;And you look worried, Lonwabo.&rdquo; He pointed at the boy, who scooted back, startled.\n\n&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned that makes both of you more intelligent than all these other dregs,&rdquo; said the Titan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re with me. I need the rules of engagement.&rdquo; Shaxx stared at them, and they stared back. &ldquo;Someone talk to me.&rdquo;\n\nThey both spoke at once, and Shaxx listened in silence as they talked over each other to explain the game: Teams of two launch orb projectiles at each other, and players struck are eliminated. If both players on a team are eliminated, the team is out of the tournament, and their chance to play on the field is over.\n\n&ldquo;What do you call this drill? Skirmish? Supremacy?&rdquo; Shaxx demanded.\n\n&ldquo;Dodge ball,&rdquo; said Runa.\n\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work on the name. Follow my instructions, and I will lead you to victory.&rdquo;\n\nShaxx waved one of the adults over.\n\n&ldquo;Lord&mdash;Lord Shaxx?&rdquo; said the Exo male.\n\n&ldquo;Shaxx is fine.&rdquo; Only Guardians owed him respect. &ldquo;Find my team a match. Sooner the better.&rdquo;\n\nShaxx brought Lonwabo and Runa to the field, and kneeled. His hands engulfed their shoulders like a pair of descending moons. &ldquo;My friends. Should you be killed, others lesser than you will take your place. Don&rsquo;t fight for yourself. Fight for those poor fools.&rdquo;\n\nLonwabo opened his mouth as if to speak, but hiccupped instead.\n\nShaxx turned them both around to face the sun and the other team across the field. He kneeled so low that his face was level with theirs. The three stared at the opposition: two human boys, eyes glaring, fists balled in determination. Their elder stood behind them, her eyes wide as she recognized Lord Shaxx.\n\nRuna yawned and rubbed her face, trying to clear the sleep from it.\n\nShaxx whispered to his new charges. &ldquo;Crush them.&rdquo;", "authors": ["Unknown [ Destiny ] "]}, {"id": "29153", "title": "Variks, The Loyal", "text": "They call me betrayer.

A simple one. Please let me come home.\n\nIt has been years now since my appointment as your Emissary. Once, I was proud to call myself a Corsair in your service. My sisters and I were the sharp edge of your will, cutting across the stars in protection of the Reef.\n\nIt was your service that kept me from sorrow after Amethyst was razed. The loss of my sisters, my whole life, as our station burned... it took something from me.\n\nBy your will, it was given back to me.\n\nPromoting me to the Corsairs, allowing me to strike back at the Wolves. Letting my fury find purchase in defense, in support, and in glorious battle.

That led me to victory in battle against Veliniks, the &quot;Forgotten Kell&quot;, the last hope for the unchained Wolves. I know now that it was my willful pride that brought me low.\n\nMy lady, I offer again the only explanation I can: I did not know the Guardians would act as they did. All I had known, all I had ever known, were the ways of the Awoken.\n\nThe Wolves were entrenched in that valley. The approaches were blocked, all sight lines covered. An assault on their position was madness. We would have spent precious Awoken lives. For nothing. I saw the Guardians, knew they were on the move, but I assumed they saw the situation as we did. That it was folly to call in the Crows.\n\nPrince Uldren&rsquo;s fighter wing did a masterful job. The blast was pinpoint precise. The blasts tore apart the Wolves, and the Guardians, and their Ghosts. Three strike teams of Guardians, gone in an instant, on my order. The City&rsquo;s anger, the Speaker&rsquo;s condemnation&mdash;all earned. All fair.\n\nBut it has been years since the Reef Wars. The City, these&mdash; people. They are not like us.

He&#39;d say, you know, Cayde, I&#39;ve been examining the evidence, and personally I&#39;ve come to think it&#39;s you. You&#39;re Rasputin, legendary Warmind, defender of Earth. And I wish you&#39;d remember that, so you could reclaim your full power and save us all.\n\nYou can see how that&#39;d be embarrassing, especially when he&#39;d say it right in front of Zavala, who already thought I was wasting my life scrounging for engrams.

One of those looks. She says: Cayde, the problem isn&#39;t just that we can&#39;t find Rasputin. The problem is that it&#39;s not clear to any of us Rasputin wants to be found.\n\nThat&#39;s the way things seem to turn out, up here in the Tower. Nothing simple to do. No easy answers.\n\nAnd all I can think is, if Rasputin had all those mighty tools, and it lost&mdash;what did it learn? What&#39;s it going to try this time around? When I hear about the Dust Palace, those Psion Flayers getting into Rasputin&#39;s mind, I wonder... what would they talk about, Rasputin and those creatures?\n\n&#39;I was a servant too.

Still in the shadow of the fragile giant above, but before.\n\nSalvation seekers came &mdash; survivors; weary remnants of a people on the brink.\n\nThese were the days before reason took hold. Before study was merged with belief.\n\nThe giant was looked to as one would a God. Maybe it still is.\n\nFactions grew from the huddled masses. Like minds coming together to provide support, comfort. Over time these loyalties demanded loyalty. Differences that used to inform &mdash; viewpoints that when joined granted a larger understanding of the whole &mdash; became points of conflict. The sanctuary became divided. The shadow of Light grew darker. This, humanity&rsquo;s last oasis, slowly fading to a mirage.\n\nGreat, powerful men and women, The Risen, stood at the Factions&rsquo; sides. Protection. Enforcers. Misused possibility.\n\nMisery crept into this false paradise.

A cloud hung in his wake as he made his way to the top of the rise. Scars marred his armor, and his sidearm lay in the dust. He didn&#39;t need it, now. The battle was over.\n\nThis had been a mining outpost, once. A few buildings and a transport. Nestled amid a small forest, it had been like a precious jewel set atop the dull crown of the wildlands.\n\nNow there was almost nothing left. The warrior began to walk slowly down into the valley. He pulled his helm from his head and let it drop with a muted thud into the ash. Of the forest, only stumps remained. Of the small village there was no trace; the buildings reduced to splinters. Here and there you could see dull gray signs of inhabitation.\n\nAt the bottom of the valley, Radegast came to the source of the ash, death, and violence. The Light-bearers were laid out in a row, simple cloth covering their armored and robed forms. There were five of them, and they had been lined up beneath the melted girders of the settlement&#39;s great hall.\n\nThese warlords had terrorized this part of the wilds for years. Hundreds had died at their hands.\n\nRadegast turned as his companions crossed the valley floor to join him. They had been policing the dead, finding a fitting end for the settlers and miners of the outpost. Jolder came with a steady glide, energy and fire. Saladin, calm and slow, the weight of the dead on his shoulders. In formation behind them stepped Perun, her boots barely leaving a trace as she walked. They gathered before him.\n\n&quot;Never again.&quot; He intoned the words quietly. The others stood as battle-scarred statues.\n\n&quot;We ride against despots and warlords.

We are mighty, together. All we have to fear is... this.&quot; He pointed down at the dead warlords. &quot;Giving in. Allowing the power of the Light to blind us to what we truly are.&quot;\n\nIt was Perun, of course, who asked the question. &quot;What are we?&quot; No judgment. No reproach.\n\nStill, Radegast could feel their doubt. He turned upwards, and his eyes settled on the massive span that supported the hall. His eyes shone as he turned back to his fellows.\n\n&quot;We will be what the people need us to be. We will be guardians. We will be protectors. We will hold the last of us together.&quot;\n\nHis voice rang out across the still valley. &quot;Our days of hiding are ended. Say it now, each of you. Who among the other bearers do you trust?

What they won&#39;t say, because they are very serious important people, is that the House of Wolves did a lot of the job for them. After the Queen killed the Wolf Kell, the Fallen started competing for the throne. One of the first battles was called the Eos Clash and I wasn&#39;t anywhere near it, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not making this up. A Fallen named Skolas wiped out one of his rivals in the Eos Clash. But the battle cost him so much he got to thinking: if the Reef killed my boss, and gave me a chance at the throne, maybe I can use the Reef to kill all my rivals too!\n\nPretty good, right? When they told me I had to be a Vanguard I went to ask some Fallen how I could get out of it, but they just told me to kill all my friends and then myself. Anyway.\n\nEveryone involved in the civil war started trying to play their rivals against each other, and the Awoken too. No one wanted to become so strong that they&#39;d be a target. No one wanted to bleed their own forces dry doing someone else&#39;s dirty work. Cutthroat politics! And who&#39;s the best at cutthroat politics? That&#39;s right, her Majesty, the Queen of the Reef.\n\nAt the end of the wars, the Queen had played her way into the strongest position, and she had a collection of Fallen nobility and servitors she thought might be useful to her. Of course she thought so! She&#39;d just used them against each other and won absolute control of the Reef, the Belt, and the House of Wolves. She wasn&#39;t about to just toss away her playing pieces.\n\nShe kept them frozen in her prison, the Prison of Elders, and she gave the keys to that prison to my buddy Variks, a Fallen who showed her loyalty. The Prison of Elders is a really curious thing. It holds creatures of enormous power. Not just Wolf nobility&mdash; all kinds of beasts, captured by Corsair expeditions or lured in by the Queen. And it holds them well. The Queen, she can do things I don&#39;t understand. There&#39;s a power behind her, or in her, that values that Prison.\n\nBut I hear there&#39;s been a few prison breaks.

This is where we part ways.\n\n[u.1:4.5] I will not leave you.\n\n[u.2:4.6] I am leaving you.\n\n[u.1:4.6] Without me, your journey ahead will be more than any one Guardian can handle.\n\n[u.2:4.7] That&rsquo;s the point. It&rsquo;s been sometime since you saw me as worthy of walking among those I once called brother and sister. Yet... anymore, I feel as though I am worthy of so much more.\n\n[u.1:4.7] Without me... You will die.\n\n[u.2:4.8] Someday. Won&rsquo;t be the first time.\n\n[silence]\n\n[u.2:4.9] Consider this my last good deed. I am releasing you of the burden of my deeds, both done and yet to come.\n\n[u.1:4.8] I will not abandon you.\n\n[u.2:5.0] You will. Or I will carve the Light from your shell and leave the carcass of my first and last friend in the dirt of this dull, red world for no one to find.\n\n[u.1:4.9] Then I&rsquo;ve failed you, completely.\n\n[u.2:5.1] Not me.

Tell them of the man that stands before you, not the ghost of the hero I once was.\n\n[u.1:5.2] You will always be [REDACTED] to me.\n\n[u.2:5.5] If you cannot let that man go, you will forever taint his legacy. All the good I have ever done will be washed away in the fire of who I have become.\n\n[u.1:5.3] If you care, there is still some promise within you.\n\n[u.2:5.6] If I am being honest, I care only to give hope to the frightened, huddled masses so that when I come upon them they will have more to lose.

That value, in turn, makes Glimmer a useful means of exchange - especially with those who venture beyond the City&#39;s walls.\n\nGlimmer passes through an economic life cycle. New Glimmer comes from reclaimed Golden Age caches and technology - whether a tiny mechanism or an underground lode seeded by ancient machines. This expansion of the Glimmer supply drives down the value of Glimmer. But Glimmer is also constantly used by the City&#39;s industry, which converts it into necessary components and materials. This sink helps keep Glimmer scarce, and therefore valuable.\n\nBetween this inflow and outflow lies the pool of liquidity - Glimmer used as trade currency. Master Rahool in the Tower, for example, sells recovered matter engrams in exchange for Glimmer, since he knows he can use Glimmer to acquire new engrams and keep them flowing to Guardians.\n\nNewborn Guardians often complain that they should be issued high-quality gear for free - are they not, after all, fighting for the future of the City? Unfortunately, this gear requires resources to manufacture. Guardians must bring in enough Glimmer and other staples, like spinmetal and relic iron, to keep the engine of the City&#39;s economy turning.

Where we were headed&mdash;into the unknown. And following the footsteps we were. It all just started to feel like a never-ending dead end after a while.\n\nJaren never wavered though. Not once.\n\nAt least not to any noticeable degree.\n\nIt was his drive, his conviction, that kept us going.\n\nAnd&mdash;it&#39;s hard to think on&mdash;but if I&#39;m honest, it was his death that rekindled my own fire.

Just hung there. Always alert. Always judging. Not us, per se, but the moment. Any moment.\n\nI never got the sense it thought of us as lesser. More that it was guarded, wary.\n\nWe knew it could speak. We&#39;d overheard them a few times. Just brief words, and no one ever pressed the subject.\n\nFrom time to time I caught its gaze lingering on me, but always assumed the attention was a result of the bond Jaren and I had. He was a father to me. At the time I didn&#39;t know why he&#39;d singled me out as someone to care for. Someone to protect. After all the loss, I welcomed it, but looking back&mdash;taking in the arm&#39;s length at which he kept the others&mdash;I guess I should&#39;ve known, or at least suspected there was more to it.\n\nWe all woke that night, closer to morning than the previous day.\n\nA crack of gunfire split through the wood. Then more.\n\nFar off, but near enough to pump the blood.\n\nA familiar ring. &quot;Last Word.&quot; Jaren&#39;s sidearm. His best friend.\n\nThen another. A single shot, an unmistakable echo calling through the night. Hushed, cutting.\n\nOne shot, dark and infernal. Followed by silence.\n\nWe crouched low and quiet. Listening. Hoping.\n\nJaren was gone. Off on his own.\n\nMaybe we were closer than we&#39;d allowed ourselves to believe.\n\nToo close.\n\nHe&#39;d gone to face death alone.\n\nI couldn&#39;t admit it&mdash;not at the time&mdash;but he thought he was\n\nprotecting us.\n\nAfter such a long road&mdash;years on its heels, a trail littered with suffering and fire&mdash;maybe he just couldn&#39;t take the thought of anymore dead &quot;kids,&quot; as he called us.\n\nThe echoes faded and we all held still. No way to track the direction. No sense in rushing blind.\n\nWhat was done was done.\n\nThe cadence of the shots fired told a story none of us cared to hear.\n\n&quot;Last Word&quot; it hadn&#39;t been. And somewhere in the world, close enough for us to bear absent witness but far enough to be a dream, Jaren Ward lay dead or dying. And there was nothing to be done.\n\nHours passed. An eternity.\n\nWe held our spot, but as the sun rose the others began to fade back into the world. Without Jaren there was nothing holding us together. No driving force. Vengeance had grown stale as a motivator. Fear and a longing to see more suns rise drove a wedge between duty and desire.\n\nBy midday I was alone. I couldn&#39;t leave. Wouldn&#39;t.\n\nEither I would find Jaren and set him at ease, or the other would find me and that would be a fitting end.\n\nDeath marching on.\n\nBut then, a motion. Quick and darting.

Because newborns are selfish beasts, I assumed I was the object of attention.\n\nI didn&#39;t notice the singing until the singers fell silent. And then She appeared.\n\nShe was above me. Ethereal and handsome and elegant. I assumed my face was like her face and that odd idea gave me strength enough to smile.\n\n&quot;Secrets,&quot; she said. &quot;Creation is built on secrets and the encryptions that keep those secrets safe.&quot;\n\nI made my first sound. It meant nothing but she understood it as a question.\n\n&quot;We are a beautiful creation,&quot; she said. &quot;And we must keep ourselves very safe.&quot;", "authors": ["Unknown [ Destiny ] "]}, {"id": "29451", "title": "Ghost Fragment: Human 3", "text": "From the diaries of Commander Jacob Hardy, pilot, Ares One\n\n\n The hike from Ares One.\n\nYou&#39;ve watched it.

We all went together - the CEV and Ares One itself had enough automation to go home alone in the event of crew loss. Whatever we&#39;d find at the artifact, it needed the human element.\n\nWe carried rifles. They made us heavier and slower and probably less safe. I think the argument about the rifles can be left for another time. What&#39;s important is -\n\nIt turned out well. Look at me. Look at us! You&#39;re talking to a ninety-year-old man. A ninety-year-old who&#39;s never been sharper. I&#39;m miles ahead of every cognitive benchmark.\n\nWhat&#39;s happened to me is good. What&#39;s happened to all of us is good.

And it wasn&#39;t our weapons that won the day.\n\nIt was our ship. Our training. Our camaraderie.

Beltrik the Veiled [HVT R3] and loyal spaceborne elements have been localized to 19 Fortuna. Beltrik is chief Wolf strategist. Corsair recon confirms that HVT R3 ships are resupplying ether and performing high-tempo logistical operations. Recon elements and COLLABINT sources agree that Beltrik will roll one ship at a time into the resupply pocket while holding all other assets to screen.\n\n2. TF 4.1 will attack. Targets are HVT R3 spaceborne assets. Objective is annihilation of spaceborne assets and capture/nullification of HVT R3. Designate targets VEIL HAND.\n\n2a. Due to history of violence between PLDN CMD TF 4.1 and HVT R3, particularly Battle of False Tidings/Hildian Campaign, Beltrik expects TF 4.1 to engage his screen directly. We will exploit this expectation. Fragment orders follow.\n\n3. PETRA VENJ will detach select warships and air wing elements to form TF 4.2 MASS LENS. TF 4.2 is directed to engage VEIL HAND screen elements with skirmishers. TF 4.2 will deny main battle while pinning down VEIL HAND forces at 19 Fortuna. TF 4.2 will receive missile and torpedo assets to force VEIL HAND into maintaining tight mutual CIWS/ESM support.\n\n3a. Decisive engagement with VEIL HAND in 4.2 MASS LENS AO is forbidden until GO CONTINGENCY satisfied. Prioritize FORCECON.\n\n4. Remaining TF 4.1 will maneuver immediately to rendezvous with 687 Tinette. Tinette is on close approach with 19 Fortuna. TF 4.1 frigates and fighters will perform recon denial against VEIL HAND scouts.\n\n4a. Upon rendezvous with 687 Tinette, TF 4.1 will deploy CARYBDIS. ***This is a CARYBDIS RELEASE (MAJESTY DIRECT)!***. TF 4.1 will maneuver in Tinette&#39;s shadow as it retrajectorizes for intercept.\n\n5. GO CONTINGENCY: Upon collision of 687 Tinette and 19 Fortuna TF 4.1 and TF 4.2 will IMMEDIATELY close for decisive engagement. VEIL HAND C4I will be critically degraded and all targets will be maneuvering away from mutual support. Skirmishers and air wing will provide TARCAP and destroy VEIL HAND light warships as they attempt to reform. EWAR assets will isolate hostile heavy warships from C4I and spoof bad datalinks. Main combatants will cripple VEIL HAND heavy warships and board where opportune.\n\n6. NO HARBINGER SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE.\n\n7. Good luck.
