He is not Dalish and says that he has never been part of the Circle, claiming instead to have studied magic peacefully on his own... particularly magic tied to the Fade.\r\n\r\nWhile I suspect you will be reluctant to accept the help of an apostate, Solas did come to us freely. Witnesses saw him in a nearby village at the time of the blast, so he was likely not responsible for what happened at the Conclave. However, he has described the effects of the Breach in enough detail to convince me that he knows more about the Fade than anyone else present.\r\n\r\nSolas has requested permission to study the lone survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach.

From there he disappeared, evading my people so easily and so completely that I am forced to wonder how much he knew about them.\r\n\r\nWhen Solas initially approached the Inquisition and offered aid, I questioned him extensively about his background and history. He was evasive, but he did give the name of the village where he grew up, noting that it was small, unlikely to appear on any map.\r\n\r\nI hate loose ends, so I kept a few of my agents searching, to verify his story. They recently located the village... or what remains of it. It is a ruin, as it has been for centuries, its name preserved only in degraded form in Ancient Tevinter mysteries.

We will never find a peaceful solution to this conflict until we admit that we were partially responsible.\r\n\r\nImagine how it must have been for Hawke when she/he rose to prominence for her/his role in ending the Qunari threat of 9:34.\r\n\r\nFrom refugee to Champion of Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nHawke&#39;s position gave her/him power and influence.

Following the destruction of the chantry, Knight-Commander Meredith invoked the Right of Annulment and called for the execution of every mage in Kirkwall.

Hawke knew it, and stood against her.\r\n\r\nShe/He put herself/himself between the templars and the mages they sought to destroy, and became a legend. Even though she/he later disappeared, fleeing Kirkwall and the Chantry&#39;s justice, what happened in Kirkwall that day changed Thedas forever.\r\n\r\nBy defying Meredith and our Order, Hawke became a beacon for mage rebellion, that gave the mages hope, rallied them. They fought back. And here we now stand, on the eve of Divine Conclave, seeking peace before their rebellion destroys us all.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Knight-Commander Marteu of Montsimmard, speaking to templars attending the Divine Conclave.\r\n\r\n<i>If Hawke sided with the templars...</i>\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you with any certainty if the Champion of Kirkwall will be present at the Divine Conclave.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hawke is the current viscount of the city, he/she left Kirkwall some time ago, leaving the running of the city to the guard-captain and the seneschal.\r\n\r\nIf either of them knows anything about their viscount&#39;s whereabouts, they are saying nothing.\r\n\r\nI understand the need some of you feel to have Hawke present.\r\n\r\nMany of you believe we would not be at war if not for his/her actions.\r\n\r\nThedas has always feared us, but the destruction of Kirkwall&#39;s chantry awoke all to the realization that some mages would go to any lengths to achieve freedom. And in the aftermath, Hawke&#39;s support of the templars&#39; systematic slaughter of all of Kirkwall&#39;s mages showed that no mercy should be spared in restoring peace.\r\n\r\nWhat Hawke did in Kirkwall sparked something in the Templar Order.

If the Champion could turn against us, surely we were beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nWhen the Circles began to rebel, the Templars did what they saw as their duty &mdash; as Hawke did in Kirkwall.

We know he became Constable of the Grey in Val Chevin after Warden-Constable Fontaine assumed the position of Commander of the Grey from her predecessor. He also bears the Silverite Wings of Valor, an honor bestowed upon Orlesian Wardens for deeds of great daring. The details of the act for which Blackwall earned the Silverite Wings, however, are sketchy. Grey Wardens hide their secrets well. The medal was likely awarded for a campaign to secure Deep Roads entrances within Orlais, shortly after the Fifth Blight. Several Grey Wardens lost ther lives on that campaign; perhaps more would be dead if not for Blackwall.\r\n\r\nAccording to my sources, Warden Blackwall has been traveling alone for several years now. The last anyone saw him at the keep in Val Chevin, it was 9:37 Dragon. It has been completely abandoned, along with all other Warden outposts. I believe Blackwall is as curious about this disappearance as we are.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in time, we will find answers.\r\n\r\nLeliana \r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a history of Thomas Rainier, prepared for delivery by Sister Leliana:\r\n\r\nRainier was born in Markham, a city-state in the Free Marches. There is little information on his early life, but he was already a skilled warrior by the time he turned eighteen. Hoping to make his fortune, he joined the Grand Tourney, that great Marcher contest of arms. He won the melee, proving himself and earning a substantial sum of gold.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to the coin Rainier won in the Tourney is a mystery. Two years later, he appeared in Orlais, no richer than at eighteen. Still, he leveraged his abilities and lingering fame to gain a place in the Orlesian army.\r\n\r\nRainier excelled as a soldier, rising through the ranks quickly to become a captain with a number of men under him. Rainier&#39;s men were fiercely loyal. Our sources believe that many would have gladly defied a higher command at his word. On the surface, Rainier safeguarded his men&#39;s interests, but further investigation reveals that he was primarily concerned with his own advancement and profit.\r\n\r\nRainier&#39;s desire to amass a fortune likely explains his involvement in the massacre of Lord Vincent Callier and his family. Our sources tell us that Rainier was approached by a chevalier: Ser Robert Chapuis. Ser Robert supported Grand Duke Gaspard&#39;s claim to the throne and wished to enter into his good graces by eliminating Lord Callier, one of Celene&#39;s staunchest allies. Chapuis hired Rainier to assassinate Callier, and offered him a great deal of coin for it. We have no reason to believe his actions were politically motivated. In the spring of 9:35, Lord Callier and his family were traveling to their summer home on Lake Celestine when their caravan was ambushed. It is unknown if Rainier realized that Callier would be traveling with his family. Rainier and his men slaughtered Lord Callier and his entourage; they spared not even the children, all four under the age of thirteen.\r\n\r\nIt seems that none of Rainier&#39;s men were aware of the true reasons behind the lord&#39;s killing. They simply followed Rainier&#39;s orders. Rumors of Rainier&#39;s connection to the murders began swirling through the upper ranks of the army, and must have given him forewarning; he was gone when guards came to arrest him. His men, however, were not so lucky. Almost all were charged with treason, save a few who managed to get away.\r\n\r\nThom Rainier was labeled a traitor and a criminal, but remained at large until now.\r\n\r\n<b>\"Blackwall\" and the Last Few Years</b>\r\n\r\n<i>If The Inquisitor pardoned Rainier...</i>\r\n\r\nInquisitor,\r\n\r\nI hope this letter finds you well.

This sort of demon develops a far more refined palate, attacking the psyche of their target rather than seeking a simple scare. Beware the fear demon that gorges upon the terror of not only a single nightmare but of a nation, for it will grow to such a size that it dominates the Fade.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From a lecture by renowned templar, Ser Hayward", "authors": "Ser Hayward"}, "21165": {"title": "A Horsemaster&#39;s Notes on Mounts", "text": "Never seen a proud rider atop a regal mount?

These aren&#39;t working beasts, with the fire bred out of their eyes so they can suffer a plow. These creatures are about spirit. A proper mount isn&#39;t some noble&#39;s plaything on a hunt, it&#39;s your everyday, and you&#39;d better match it to deserve it.\n\nOn Horses\n\nYou&#39;ve never had a mount like the Fereldan Forder, a hardy warmblood. Don&#39;t let the size fool you: they&#39;re no meant for the farm. Centuries of careful breeding have taken common stock and produced a glory. A creature as much at home in a charge as they are in a march across nations. But for all the stamina and speed they place at your command, press too far, and you&#39;ll be picking dirt from your teeth. They know their role and expect that you know yours. Warning and promise and all that.\n\nOn the Flames of the Inquisition Armored Charger\n\nNever in all my days did I think I would handle such barding, never mind the quality of the breed. A true purebred lineage, clad in the hallmarks of a master. The combination is one of a kind, and this animal knows it. Mount and rider, meant for greatness. Don&#39;t disappoint - The bar has been set very, very high.\n\nOn the Red Hart\n\nHonored to see one up close without meeting it points-first. The pride of the stable. Of any stable. Even the Dalish I&#39;ve had occasion to ask have said it&#39;s rare to glimpse them at a distance. The few who have mastered one - and it truly is very few - say there is no animal more sure of foot, more attuned to its rider, more inspirational to simply gaze upon. You want to match the majesty of this creature? Grow some bloody wings.\n\nOn the &quot;Bog Unicorn&quot;\n\nStill not sure what you unearthed. Talked to a mage about it and got a typical &quot;head in the Fade&quot; response. Got a better answer from that Tranquil of yours, and it still chilled my short hairs. Plain speak, there&#39;s a spirit of some kind in there. Now, a horse to me means &quot;freedom&quot;, but I understand that sometimes it&#39;s a demon? The wrong side of what it should be. What&#39;s the wrong side of freedom? Chaos or just &quot;unending&quot;? Something like that. Whatever is in there, this animal was best of breed, an Orlesian charger fit for any Chevalier, and well tended in life. By its wounds, I&#39;d wager it fell in battle with demons of some ilk and was finished by its master&#39;s mercy. Whatever spirit of loyalty or freedom or whatever makes horses run brought the strange thing back. It wants to serve. I&#39;ve no doubt it will ride well, and I&#39;ll stable it, but I&#39;m not going near it.\n\nOn the Dracolisk\n\nI&#39;ve heard of them. Seen a few. They&#39;re not as rare as you&#39;d think, but they are very, very difficult. &quot;Spirited&quot; and &quot;stubborn&quot; suggest a reasonable resistance. No, they&#39;re just plain mean. Spur a horse a little too hard, and you&#39;re getting a brush against a tree. Kick this thing the wrong way, and it&#39;s taking a piece of you. That said, there&#39;s utility here. As fast and strong as any other, and the rider who masters one is making a statement. Not just &quot;I can do what you can&#39;t&quot;. It&#39;s almost &quot;I can do what you wouldn&#39;t even dare&quot;.\n\nGreater Mountain Nuggalope or &quot;Deth Nug&quot;\n\nIt has hands. It handles things. That&#39;s hitting me worse than anything else. What the ever-loving spit? Can&#39;t argue the impressive stature of the thing, and it&#39;s stubborn, like the most entitled charger. It knows how strong it is, and it knows you know. I expected the dull snuffling of its small cousins, but this - it has hands and spirited eyes. Mind where you secure the buckles of your saddle.

A demon of pride may gravitate to the corrupt hubris of nobles, the bloodthirsty arrogance of soldiers, or sadly, the blind confidence of mages. A demon of desire may focus on lust, greed, or even the desperate wishes of those with no recourse in the waking world.\n\nWhether demons are naturally inclined to such specificity, or made so by observing a confluence of specific events in our world, is a subject of much debate, and not the question my experiment would answer. Instead, I turn to the question of fear.\n\nWe think of fear demons as lesser creatures, powerful but simple, like those common beasts of rage or hunger. But fear has many faces, from the absurd phobias of the pampered nobility to the very real threats of magic, demons, dragons, and perhaps especially, the Blight.\n\nWhat event has shaped the course of human history more than the Blights? Had the First Blight not weakened it, the Tevinter Imperium would have crushed Andraste&#39;s rebellion; we would have no Ferelden, no Circles, and indeed, no Chantry as we know it. The Blight is unequaled as a force of devastation and terror, hated and feared by peasant and king alike from the northern hills of the Anderfels to the southern reaches of the Korcari Wilds.\n\nI know of nothing else that inspires such universal and specific fear. Dragons and demons, yes, but both have found respect and fascination in cultures across Thedas. Only the Blight is an unadulterated source of horror. If there exists a demon of fear who has shaped itself into a more intelligent, more specific mold, it will be a demon focusing on fear of the Blight.\n\nThis is the experiment I undertake. By the time you read this, my friends, I will be asleep, traveling through the Fade to find such a creature.

Those who insist that mages are harmless must ask how the apostates who fling fire when the Templars attack learned how to kill so well.

A mage&#39;s strike rarely hits with the force of a trained chevalier&#39;s blade, but often carries unnatural energies: fire that boils a man inside his armor, lightning that steals the strength from his limbs, and so forth. To hold back is to give him time to alter the battlefield to his advantage in some fashion, whether he summons a wall of ice, a demonic ally, or magical flames to strengthen the blades of his guards. We know that the warrior who controls the battlefield is most often the victor. You must keep him reacting to you and continue your attack.\r\n\r\nMages rarely wear heavy armor, but their magic can shield them as effectively as our own plate. I have said many times to watch the hips and arms of your opponent instead of the hands, but with the mage, the hands and arms may be your only clue.

Although the power contained in these objects is difficult to focus, the diffused magic can easily distribute energy across a broad area, augmenting the mage&#39;s allies. The spellbinders insist that no individual spirit is capable of breaking their bindings, and that the spirits cannot cooperate well enough to effect an escape together. Furthermore, they maintain that because the bindings are all tied to the spellbinder personally, there is no risk of these enchanted books falling into the wrong hands.\n\nStill, the books are in their hands, and I am concerned. Although the practice has spread across most of Thedas by now, it seems to have originated in Tevinter. These mages bind spirits and demons too readily, and it is not natural for spirits to remain in this world for any great length of time.

A skilled warrior is struck down by a maul or battleaxe in one of three cases: in the first, he is taken unawares in the heat of battle; in the second, he cannot evade the blow because of the nature of the battlefield or his own injuries; and in the third and most common case, he is struck down because he reacts poorly.\n\nWe do not train enough against two-handed weapons because we disdain them ourselves. I think this is a mistake, and in time to come, I hope it is corrected. I have seen too many skilled warriors die because they have seen a great maul coming down at them and raise a shield to block instead of deflect. I have seen men lose their composure due to fear or anger and engage such a warrior directly, thinking they can risk a blow to their body as they would from a light sword or a dagger. In the heat of battle, even the trained mind will think such things. Those who cannot overcome such thoughts die.\n\nYou must watch the weapon, but only to gauge its length. Otherwise, as in all fights, the opponent&#39;s hips and shoulders will tell his intent. The great weapons are dangerous only when moving or poised overhead to strike down. You must give ground, but only against the true threat. If he advances but is not truly prepared to strike, you must rush in, cut him, and withdraw to your guard before his blow is ready. It may take ten cuts to kill him. Even after the ninth, he may cleave your head from your body if you do not respect the distance he can cover.\n\nIf using such a weapon yourself, mark your distance and do not allow yourself to react to an opponent outside your reach. You cannot recover your guard as quickly as you can with a sword and shield. Keep your weapon moving and measure your blows. A stuttered step on your strike can fool many opponents into thinking you out of range and then rushing their defense. In this manner, you may kill most who stand against you. Fighting in such a manner, you may feel more like a butcher than a hero, but the living may console themselves while the dead cannot.\n\n&mdash;An excerpt from A Meditation upon the Use of Blades by Swordmaster Massache de Jean-mien, required reading at the Academie des Chevaliers", "authors": "Swordmaster Massache de Jean-mien"}, "21198": {"title": "Gurn", "text": "&quot;We woke to a herd from nowhere, just standing around the camp.

Other than invoking the gods, spirits have nothing to do with the process. It is the essence, the soul, which returns clothed in new flesh.\n\nThe core of the concept is thus: the souls of a few Avvar &quot;favored&quot; by fate &quot;migrate&quot; on death to inhabit a new body destined for them, so they may return and perform great deeds for the good of their hold. These resurrected souls are not expected to remember their past selves consciously, but instead are assumed to be subtly &quot;guided&quot; by their previous experiences, especially through visions and portents. This most conveniently sidesteps the need for proof that one has been &quot;reborn&quot; or that such things even occur.

The most talented Shaper of Runes in dwarven history, escaping with his entire house to the surface&mdash;now that will fluff some beards in the Shaperate!\r\n\r\nMy father said our old family business used to be near an archway that was part of Fairel&#39;s Paragon statue. I wish I could have shown him this. He&#39;s the one who wanted to believe our ancestors in the Stone were still guiding us. Be nice to think it were true, old man.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nI was tracing heraldry etched on a wall when I noticed pictures of weapons with winged lizards worked into the decoration. I spent the rest of the day translating the inscriptions. This verse was apparently passed down through Fairel&#39;s house, through his father to his father&#39;s father and so on for hundred of generations:\r\n\r\n&quot;From the Stone, have no fear of anything,\r\nbut the stone-less sky betrays with wings of flame.\r\nIf the surface must be breached, if there is no other\r\nway,\r\nbring weapons against the urtok, and heed their\r\nscreams.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Urtok&quot; means &quot;dragon.&quot; Why was it part of an ancient crest? Why were these dwarves so worried about a monster they&#39;d never see that they worked it into their weapons?\r\n\r\nThis place becomes more impossible each day.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA few days ago, I turned from a statue to find a human woman staring at me. She didn&#39;t react when I screamed, or when I ran around picking up my dropped notes. When I asked who she was and how long she&#39;d been standing there, she quoted some verses of the Chant at me, polite as you please. I offered her some water, but she shook her head, pointed to the east, and said &quot;Blessed are those with fortitude, for they persevere in the name of the Maker.&quot; When I glanced back, she was gone.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman must be touched. She seemed harmless, but I don&#39;t know how she gets around so quickly in this heat.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nI have just discovered Fairel&#39;s tomb in the east. I&#39;ve never seen something so sodding grand in all my life. I won&#39;t write an essay on this place, I&#39;ll write a book. Several books. I will be rich and bring a whole expedition here and the University of Orlais will beg me to lecture when I&#39;m not presenting my findings to the empress herself over dinner.\r\n\r\nThat is, if I can get inside the Fairel&#39;s tomb. The doors are sealed tight. It looks like there&#39;s a keyhole, but none of the ruins I&#39;ve seen have anything even hinting at a key. On the way out, I saw I&#39;d missed a few bones on the ground. They were still bloody. Sheer luck that whatever lives there wasn&#39;t home when I arrived.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA group of human mages have moved in. They&#39;re digging out buildings deep in the sand. When I tried to approach them, one of the workers dragged me aside and whispered to me to leave before &quot;the Venatori&quot; caught me. I wasn&#39;t going to listen until he showed me his cuts. These mages have been bleeding him for their spells!\r\n\r\nI ran. I wish there were something I could do. What do these &quot;Venatori&quot; want? the buildings I saw looked like tombs in the ancient style. Fairel was a master runesmith. Maybe the city revered his work enough to seal it away...\r\n\r\nNot a good day. Sandstorm blew in for hours, and I was almost bitten in half by one of those terrible spiders.

Nevertheless, it occupies a peculiar niche in the tools of warfare due to its requirements. Any army wishing to produce trebuchets or catapults must be funded and organized well enough to procure both the necessary materials and the military experts to construct them. Throughout history, most armies who fulfilled such requirements did not take advantage of such situation. During the Third Blight, for example, Arlesans and Montsimmard constructed catapults to fling flaming debris at the darkspawn, but the expense of the weapons did not justify the limited damage they caused, and the darkspawn were ultimately driven back by the Grey Wardens, not siege weaponry.\r\n\r\nTevinter forces similarly had the resources to construct siege weapons when attacking the Free Marchers or defending themselves against the Exalted Marches of the Black Age. Instead, the Imperium focused primarily upon the power of its magisters, who were less powerful but more flexible than siege equipment, and who could more easily fall back when the tide of battle turned.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in the battles against the Qunari in the Steel Age, generals found to their chagrin that the great oxmen had left them behind. Qunari blackpowder is, most military experts agree, not magic&mdash;it is merely an advanced alchemy that makes their cannons more effective than any trebuchet could ever be.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there remains hope.

Thus it is my moral imperative to propose an alternate interpretation: that the Exalted March of the Dales was nothing more than an expansionist ploy hiding behind the mask of faith.\n\nIt is easy to see on any map how large the Dales are. More importantly, they stand between Orlais and the rest of the south and would likely have represented a significant obstacle to the empire&#39;s expansion into Ferelden. Naturally, we stood to benefit from propagating the narrative of a hostile, unreasoning people attacking innocent missionaries and making blood sacrifices of good Andrastian babies. The likely truth is that the elves merely wished to maintain sovereignty over lands promised to them by Blessed Andraste herself, when the humans showed clear intent to undermine their autonomy.\n\nOf course, the elves reacted by becoming increasingly isolationist, which suited the empire perfectly. Here was a kingdom that spurned diplomatic overtures and that refused to lend aid during the Second Blight when the darkspawn attacked Montsimmard. The Dalish kingdom could not be anything but a dormant threat, one that needed to be crushed before it awoke.\n\nScholars point to the massacre at Red Crossing as the impetus for the Chantry&#39;s declaration of an Exalted March on the elven kingdom in the Dales. They conveniently ignore the fact that no one alive truly knows what happened at Red Crossing or why the elves attacked. The Chantry&#39;s response to the elven aggression that resulted in the slaughter of hundreds was predictable. But in light of my thesis, perhaps we should reexamine the events of Red Crossing and wonder if the attack was truly unprovoked.

Those who do, believe it predated the Chantry, hunting cultists and mages in a reign of terror ending only upon its transformation into the Templar Order. This is not quite the truth.\n\nOne must keep in mind the state of Thedas prior to the Chantry&#39;s creation: a world where the only source of order&mdash;the Tevinter Imperium&mdash;had fallen apart. People blamed magic for the death of Andraste, the Blight, the terror they saw every day&mdash;and not without reason. Abominations and demons rampaged the countryside. No one was safe. Disparate groups of men and women initially formed the Seekers of Truth, determined to reestablish order because no one else would do what was necessary. The truth they sought, the question they tried to answer, was how to restore sanity in a world gone mad.\n\nWas theirs a reign of terror? Perhaps. Evidence suggests they were as vigilant in their protection of mages as they were of regular people. When they intervened, they convened an ad hoc trial to determine the guilty party. This even application of justice led to their poor reputation; the Seekers came down against every group at one time or another, their &quot;Inquisition&quot; gaining notoriety for being on no one&#39;s side but their own. They considered themselves good people, however&mdash;followers of the Maker&#39;s true commandments. This was never more evident than when they lay down their banner in support of the fledgling Chantry.

He was a friend of Emperor Drakon. He was Inquisitor when the Seekers of Truth folded themselves into the Chantry as part of the Nevarran Accord, their Order serving as precursor to the Order of Templars and the Circle of Magi. Shortly after the accord was signed, between 1:22 and 1:24 Divine, Ameridan left his position and departed, never to be seen again.\n\nThese facts alone are undisputed. Everything else is uncorroborated hearsay, broad speculation, or salacious rumormongering:\n\n&mdash;Ameridan did not willingly cede power. Drakon forced the Seekers of Truth to disband upon pain of death, then removed the Inquisitor rather than suffer rebellion in the new Chantry&#39;s ranks.\n\n&mdash;Ameridan was forced to retire due to the still-young Chantry&#39;s restrictions requiring celibacy, as he was involved in a relationship with a mysterious &quot;lady-mage&quot; that the Chantry erased from history.\n\n&mdash;Ameridan was a rowdy noble who cared more for raucous entertainment than for the Seekers. He held the position only because Drakon wanted a loyal friend commanding the Order, and when the Seekers became part of the Chantry, Ameridan was free to retire to a life of hunting dragons and wenching.\n\nAny of these stories may be true, and without more evidence, we have little hope of ever reaching a clear determination. Nevertheless, I would offer a few notes that are often overlooked as scholars delve so deeply into their own historical specialties as to lose key context:\n\nFirstly, Emperor Drakon, rightly acknowledged as the man who molded the Chantry into the organization it is today, was a pious man, committed to spreading the Chant of Light and creating a world where magic and men were governed by Andrastian principles. All sources agree that Ameridan was a close friend of Drakon, and while it is certainly possible that Ameridan was more pragmatic than pious, it is highly unlikely that Drakon would have befriended a figure who was actively opposed to the Chantry, much less tolerated such a man holding a position of power in the growing Orlesian Empire.\n\nSecondly, Inquisitor Ameridan was universally acclaimed as a powerful combatant, regardless of his supposed faith (or lack thereof). Rumormongers suggesting Ameridan was exiled ask us to believe that Emperor Drakon could see no use for a powerful warrior with years of command experience. Given that the Second Blight had been a fact of Orlesian life for more than 15 years at the time of Ameridan&#39;s disappearance, with darkspawn pouring from the Anderfels into northern Orlais in growing numbers, it is frankly absurd to suggest Drakon would casually dispose of such a military asset.\n\nWithout further evidence, we may never know more about Ameridan&#39;s departure. Nevertheless, I hope that we may eschew the currently popular cynicism, at least when obvious evidence against it is presented, to see that his disappearance must have had some other cause.\n\n&mdash;From Finding Ameridan by Professor Bram Kenric (Starkhaven University Press)", "authors": "Professor Bram Kenric"}, "21272": {"title": "The Mystery of June", "text": "Each elven &quot;god&quot; represents an aspect of their ancient civilization, each story a metaphor for this aspect.

Indeed, even to suggest there was once disagreement was considered the direst heresy... until today, when we have lost even the memory of disagreement.

Like the great oak tree, they were constant in their traditions, strong in their roots, and ever reaching for the sky.\n\nThey felt no need to rush when life was endless. They worshiped their gods for months at a time. Decisions came after decades of debate, and an introduction could last for years. From time to time, our ancestors would drift into centuries-long slumber, but this was not death, for we know they wandered the Fade in dreams.\n\nIn those ages, our people called all the land Elvhenan, which in the old Elven language means &quot;place of our people.&quot; And at the center of the world stood the great city of Arlathan, a place of knowledge and debate, where the best of the ancient elves would go to trade knowledge, greet old friends, and settle disputes that had gone on for millennia.\n\nBut while our ancestors were caught up in the forever cycle of ages, drifting through life at what we today would consider an intolerable pace, the world outside the lush forests and ancient trees was changing.\n\nThe humans first arrived from Par Vollen to the north. Called shemlen, or &quot;quicklings,&quot; by the ancients, the humans were pitiful creatures whose lives blinked by in an instant. When they first met the elves, the humans were brash and warlike, quick to anger and quicker to fight, with no patience for the unhurried pace of elven diplomacy.\n\nBut the humans brought worse things than war with them. Our ancestors proved susceptible to human diseases, and for the first time in history, elves died of natural causes. What&#39;s more, those elves who spent time bartering and negotiating with humans found themselves aging, tainted by the humans&#39; brash and impatient lives. Many believed that the ancient gods had judged them unworthy of their long lives and cast them down among the quicklings. Our ancestors came to look upon the humans as parasites, which I understand is similar to the way the humans see our people in the cities. The ancient elves immediately moved to close Elvhenan off from the humans, for fear that this quickening effect would crumble the civilization.\n\n&mdash;The Fall of Arlathan, as told by Gisharel, keeper of the Ralaferin clan of the Dalish elves", "authors": "Gisharel"}, "21292": {"title": "The First Blight: Chapter 1", "text": "Thedas is a land of fierce diversity, from the assassin-princes of Antiva to the faded griffons of the Anderfels, but in my travels, I have found one tale that unites the people of this land. It is a story of pride and damnation, and although the telling differs, the essence of the tale remains the same.\n\nAt the height of its power, the Tevinter Imperium stretched over much of Thedas, uniting the known world under the rule of the tyrannical magisters. It is said that the Old Gods whom the magisters worshipped gave them the knowledge of blood magic, and the magisters used this forbidden power to cement their rule. The blood of elven slaves and humans alike ran down imperial altars to fuel magister greed, the tales of their excesses so horrifying that one can only be grateful that blood magic is prohibited today.\n\nBut all that stands tall must eventually fall. Perhaps they foresaw their ruin, or perhaps their pride knew no bounds, but whatever the reason, the magisters dared to open a magical portal into the Golden City at the heart of the Fade. They sought to usurp the Maker&#39;s throne, long left unattended in the Golden City after the Maker turned His back on His creations. They would storm heaven itself with their power and become as gods.\n\nThis is what the Chantry, in its oft-exercised tendency to understate, refers to as the second sin.\n\nAccording to most versions of the tale, the magisters did indeed reach the Golden City and walked into the home of the Maker, where no living being before them had dared, or been able, to tread. But humanity is not meant to walk in heaven. The magisters were wicked with pride and other sins, and their presence tainted the Golden City. What once was a perfect, holy citadel became a twisted home of darkness and nightmares. The magisters were expelled back through their gateway and cursed for their treachery. As the Golden City had been tainted, so were the magisters twisted and transformed into things of darkness&mdash;the very first of the darkspawn. The Golden City, once a shining beacon at the heart of the Fade, became the Black City, a reminder of all that man&#39;s pride has cost.\n\n&mdash;From Tales of the Destruction of Thedas, by Brother Genitivi, Chantry Scholar", "authors": "Brother Genitivi"}, "21293": {"title": "Vir Dirthara: Homecoming", "text": "The pages of this book&mdash;memory?&mdash;describe an elf approaching a city of glass spires so deeply blue they ache.

His elder brother, Emperor Judicael II, had two twin sons and thus a very secure line. Florian was free to pursue other interests, none of which revolved around the Game. Indeed, the Imperial Court largely ignored him, and that was how he liked it. All that was recorded of that era is that he married, produced a single daughter, and afterwards showed little interest in her.\n\nAn outbreak of the Hundred Days Cough in 8:77 Blessed changed his plans. Both of Judicael&#39;s sons perished, as did Florian&#39;s daughter. Wracked by grief, Judicael lost interest in ruling, turning over all matters pertaining to the rebellion in Ferelden to his advisors and instead spending his time hunting in the country. When Judicael was thrown from his horse during a fox hunt in 8:84 Blessed, Florian was suddenly vaulted into the throne. Famously, his response to the chevaliers delivering the news at his estate is said to be, &ldquo;This will not do at all.&rdquo;\n\nA private and somewhat eccentric man, Florian limited his appearances at court and dealt almost exclusively with members of his own family. He was extremely particular about his habits of dress and grooming, eschewing current fashion for the sake of comfort and refusing to wear cosmetics or powders of any kind due to an intense dislike of being &quot;dirty.&quot; Powerful and connected nobles who had served in the cabinet since his father&#39;s time were turned away in favor of his younger brother, Reynaud; his sister, Melisande; and his cousins. Children were banned from the palace, even the children of servants, with the exceptions of his nephew and nieces, who were tolerated only on the condition that they remain out of the emperor&#39;s sight.\n\nRegarding suggestions that Florian and his youngest cousin, Meghren, were lovers, the truth is uncertain. If such a relationship existed, it was no doubt kept private due to Florian&#39;s aversion to public life and not from any fear of rumors. Such rumors, after all, were likely spread due to the emperor&#39;s refusal to sire another child and thus secure his line&mdash;many believed this failing would eventually lead to civil war. The only real evidence of a relationship with Meghren is a loud and very public argument the two had prior to Meghren&#39;s appointment (or exile, as he saw it) to the throne of Ferelden. Meghren is said to have called Florian &quot;my darling,&quot; and neither man chose to explain the argument later.\n\nThe predictions of civil war almost came to pass upon Florian&#39;s death in 9:19 Dragon.

In another, the same symbol indicates a harsh slave owner but not one with a fatal temper.\n\nThe ruling class&#39;s general indifference to the moods and fears of their slaves makes this pictorial argot an important method of communication. It is therefore all the more strange so many Tevinter comedies center around a farcical misunderstanding of a sloppily written sigil, where witty slaves scramble to subvert blame in time to avoid beheading.

Popularly attributed to Archon Hessarian, Silence depicts the Maker as more sorrowful at the corruption and betrayal of His children&mdash;both spirit and mortal. He mourns the fall and corruption of the Old Gods as His own mistake, and urges His mortal children to turn aside from the dark path their elder siblings have led them down.\r\n\r\nMost historians agree that Archon Hessarian had indeed likely written this Canticle during the bloody Tevinter Transfiguration.

In the sixth verse, the grieving Maker calls upon His mortal children to acknowledge that the dragon gods have manipulated and deceived them, and to throw off their corruptive influence and return to the Light.

And there are still many citizens who cling to the hope that the empress will restore the city to the empire.\n\nHistorians mostly agree that it was not the dragons, nor the silver, and certainly not the goats that began centuries of warfare between Orlais and Nevarra. It was Emperor Etienne Valmont and the Pentaghasts.\n\nIn 7:82 Storm, the Pentaghast family, fresh on the throne again for the first time in generations and eager to build up the alliances lost by the Van Markham dynasty, approached the emperor to solidify a peace treaty through marriage. The emperor, who was under great pressure to produce an heir, set aside his empress of 17 years and wed Princess Sotiria Pentaghast, theoretically cementing a promise of peace and cooperation between Nevarra and Orlais.\n\nPromises are hard to keep. By 7:97 Storm Sotiria was still childless, and the emperor sent her to a cloister so that he might marry his mistress. As anyone other than Etienne might have predicted, the Nevarrans took this poorly. Angry letters arrived in the Imperial Palace by the cartload. A small war party of Pentaghasts rode into Orlais and reclaimed Princess Sotiria. But the Nevarrans did not take military action yet. They were strategists, and knew to bide their time.\n\nIn 8:46 Blessed, while most of the Orlesian army was committed to a war in Ferelden, the Pentaghasts began their war against Orlais.

Doesn&#39;t matter, those are all shallow details, probably followed by &quot;and it speaks to me because my soul something regret whatever.&quot;\n\nNow, the first thing those spits don&#39;t understand is that carving isn&#39;t just what you see. They&#39;ve never made a physical thing and don&#39;t know the how of it. Depth is all tricks of shadow and such; the actual cuts are only as deep as the sculptor wants. And if you take a flat edge to this thing, what she wanted is strange. Because what I&#39;m thinking is that this is one Archdemon and the three heads are the reaction to the three lines. Because piercing-line-one is on the same tier as the Tevinter second from left, and the middle head turned away. Piercing-line-two is the same tier as Tevinter fifth from left, and the first head turned away. And the line that misses it, that&#39;s the same tier as the big Tevinter, farthest out. And the dragon is looking straight at him. So the ones who did damage, the dragon doesn&#39;t care. The one who faked it, the dragon gives him an eyeful.\n\nNow, add to that: artists like to hit big targets, but this carving has no faces. If she wanted to carve specific people, they&#39;d be there, she has that skill. So, what if she&#39;s not after the magisters, she&#39;s carved Tevinter itself? You&#39;ve got four ages of the empire where they&#39;re part of the dragon, two where they damage it, and one where they miss the point entirely and it gets them eaten.

The middle boy, he was tasked with ruling the lands to be the Marches. No claim by the father was made, no &quot;in my name&quot; to humble. And that freedom is shown in the result, for Evrion himself was the least concerned with power. He among all led by example, not demand, and spoke only of sacrifice.

Never did he sit on the throne, and he is thought to have rarely visited. But his name is hated there most of all, for it was bartered for legacy by the son. Unlike Evrion, Verald spoke not as example but to claim. Never his name was mentioned without that of his mother and father. His claims were bold&mdash;their actions were his, and their thoughts all shared. But from the father on his throne in Ferelden, no word is recorded. And we wonder: was it deliberate?\n\nFor when the betrayal was revealed, all with ties to Maferath were vilified. And so strong were the ties that Verald had drawn, that his court was killed to a man, and he was forced to flee. Had he kept silent, as seems the will of the knowing father, and had he girded as the father had guided the elder, Isorath, then Verald might have remained to rule.\n\nBut that would require that the betrayer not be as he is drawn.

A grand statue of a woman in Rivaini royal garb towers over the entrance, her watchful eyes keeping sight of everything happening within those walls: Asha Subira Bahadur Campana, Queen Mother of Thedas.\n\nWhen the matriarchs of Rivain arranged the marriage of Princess Asha of Ayesleigh to King Alonzo Campana of Antiva, it went unnoticed and unremarked by their contemporaries; the eyes of Thedas were on the wars of Orlais and Nevarra. The marriage of a minor princess of Rivain to an almost powerless king was beneath their consideration. Yet this wedding was, in retrospect, perhaps the most important event in Thedas&#39;s history since the blackening of the Golden City.\n\nQueen Asha was a skilled tactician; seeing the military ambitions of Tevinter, Nevarra, and Orlais, she concocted a plan. Antiva was too prosperous to escape its neighbors&#39; avarice, yet had no means of raising an army capable of fending off both Tevinter and Orlais without impoverishing the kingdom. If she was to safeguard her people, it must be through measures stronger than steel.\n\nThe queen spent decades making alliances in the ancient Rivaini way: marriage. She wed her many children and grandchildren strategically into nobles houses across the continent. Within thirty years, Antiva was so well-connected that any hostile action against it would force half the nations of Thedas into war.\n\nThe blood of Queen Asha runs in the veins of the Empress of Orlais, the Prince of Starkhaven, the King of Nevarra, and seven of the Dukes of the Anderfels; even some magisters of the Tevinter Imperium have ties to the Antivan royal family.

It adorns the crest of the Valmonts, the family that has ruled the empire since the end of the Exalted Age, and in truth it is the Valmonts which have come to represent Orlais. Before them, the Orlesian symbol was that of the descendants of Kordillus Drakon: a dragon.\n\nAs to why the lion adorns their crest? That dates back to the time of Lambert Valmont, a young captain of Orlais who distinguished himself at the Battle of Ayesleigh, that great and infamous battle that ended the Fourth Blight. It is said that young Valmont disregarded orders during the battle, taking his forces to relieve the beleaguered Antivans and saving them from absolute destruction. Though his superiors were at first chagrined, chalking up the captain&#39;s actions to an infatuation with a certain Antivan camp follower (this, incidentally, has never been confirmed), it later came to light that the Antivan force had been led by King Azar Adalberto Campana himself. In the political realignment following the Blight&#39;s end, Antiva was an important ally to Orlais&mdash;and Lambert Valmont was an Antivan hero. He was given the hand of one of King Azar&#39;s daughters in marriage and elevated to noble rank, with a valiant lion to adorn his newly created heraldry. The Orlesian emperor was forced to respond in kind, granting Valmont a marquisate. Imagine, if you will, the hero returning to Val Royeaux from the Blight, sporting a wife with royal blood and the honors of two nations. This is why jealous nobles called him the Swaggering Lion, a nickname he embraced.\n\nIt was Lambert Valmont&#39;s son, Alphonse, who later led the civil war against the usurper, Xavier Drakon. He killed Xavier in single combat, giving rise to the great Orlesian legend of the Lion Slaying the Dragon, putting an end to the Drakon dynasty as he assumed the throne... and changing the Orlesian symbol forever.\n\n&mdash;From a letter by Brother Genitivi to Prince Cailan Theirin, 9:20 Dragon", "authors": "Brother Genitivi"}, "21329": {"title": "Way of the Necromancer", "text": "From &quot;Mortalitasi: For the Living, the Dead.&quot; The words of Speaker Viuus Anaxas make one passage stand out:\n\nWe are of this world, and as with any piece that seeks to leave its element, there is a void when we abandon the mortal.

I&#39;d guess she worked from portraits, which means they were people who considered themselves important enough to need them. The scene is a classic example of &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot; because the sculptor hates them. It&#39;s in the way it&#39;s carved: all fast, hard edges. Uglier than they need to be, even for your average Tevinter who - and this isn&#39;t just me, mind - stands like a lanky vein of lyrium. But don&#39;t mistake that for sloppy carving. It&#39;s natural, practiced. The carver knows Tevinter. Bet she is one, and it&#39;s self-hate, probably.\n\nAnd obvious enough. There&#39;s skulls all over, and two big and horned. That brings to mind your Qunari, and fair enough, right? Tevinters hate Qunari and have ever since they showed up. No magister wants his mouth contradicted, let alone stitched. So it makes sense they&#39;re there, even that early, I suppose.\n\nBecause this is probably that business of readying to invade the Fade, and giants with horns are a good motivator to sodding hurry up. Odd thing, though, is that those two are not the only Qunari in the carving. The one in the middle was sculpted with horns, and someone has gone in later and chipped them off. You can tell by the surface of it. Well, maybe you can&#39;t. But I can.\n\nSeen it happen time and again. Tastes change, and the ancestor&#39;s nudes are suddenly embarrassing. So in comes a new hand to paint on some clothes. And here, judging by the marks, to cut away the horns and make the victim look human. Some proud new owner didn&#39;t want to throw out the antiquity, but also didn&#39;t want people to think grandm&#39;ma sliced up Qunari. Looks like they didn&#39;t care if she kept their heads around, though.\n\nSo! The carvers both wanted to show Tevinter being shits, but the later one didn&#39;t want to show what about.

Heras shared a mathematical formula he had recently proven, while Etrenne explained her study on magical themes in the Chant of Light, and young Rhys talked a little about his mother.\n\nWhen we were finished, the spirit thanked us for the conversation and then vanished, although none of us had dismissed it. We soon discovered that the summoning ritual we had devised was critically flawed. The spirit had been under no compulsion to come or remain. All the time it had talked with us, it had stayed of its own volition. Heras was greatly concerned that such a powerful spirit remained free, and has updated the ritual to correct for the weakness in the binding enchantment.

We kept the land safe from further encroachment, but as each new Age dawned, memories of our sacrifice became fainter. The entire Western Approach had become a wasteland, and thus the expense of maintaining the fortress became increasingly difficult to justify. There were no griffons to fill its weyrs, too few Wardens to man its battlements, too many good men and women killed by demons creeping through the thinning Veil... each visit of the Warden-Commander made it more apparent that Adamant had become a symbol of our decline. Even if darkspawn still emerged from the chasm, who would they threaten other than the Wardens themselves?\n\nSo in the dawn of the Blessed Age, we sealed the fortress&#39;s mighty gates. We left the great griffon statues to tarnish in the blowing sand, retreating to Montsimmard with a sense of loss and shame. I returned recently with a small expedition to retrieve supplies, surprised to see it still standing. The dwarves did well by us; I suspect Adamant will remain for ages to come... but should the Order ever return, they will find it difficult to resurrect.

I believe they were meant to be seen from a great height, for river and island would make a good landmark for a bird&#39;s eye. This island is obviously the place where Tevinter first Contacted the Moon Men.\r\n\r\nThis would explain why the River was Clearly Diverted from its original path in the past, as one can see if they follow the old river banks! Did Tevinter use the Ley Lines to do this? Did the Moon Men fly? Do they look like us, only greyer? Much remains to be Discovered!\r\n\r\nThe True Purpose of the Crater\r\n\r\nLord L&#39;Rouche of Montsimmard once was Witness to &quot;tremors that collapsed an old Chantry, along with a meadow, into a deep and giant depression.&quot; He blamed it on &quot;the Fereldan Crown&quot; using &quot;dark magic to disrespect Orlais&#39; superiority.&quot; The Orlesian was only half right, for I know now this was the work of the Serpent-Folk instead.\r\n\r\nIf one looks keenly, once can see the Frostback Basin must have been manipulated by the hand of some Vast Thing. The crater in the Lowland Fortress was not the natural settling of mountains, but came to exist after the shifting of Something Below Ground! The Snake-Kings must be vast, and their movements powerful to cause the Earth to Quake with their moving. It is Clear as the Sky that Ancient Tevinter, along with the Moon Men, came here to make an Attempt to kill a buried Snake-King under the crater!!! Too many Signs and Portents are aligned to think anything else.\r\n\r\nSomeone has sketched landmarks on the back of the papers: a crumbling Tevinter wall standing in a shallow marsh, an island in the middle of a river, something that looks like a Tevinter prison, and a small Tevinter outpost with a terrace on one side and a metal sculpture in the courtyard.\r\n", "authors": "Unknown [Dragon Age]"}, "21453": {"title": "New Clients", "text": "To Master Kells:\n\nThe new client wants double the red lyrium shipped last time.

Why would I go back?\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nSeveral pages have been torn out or scratched over until the next legible section:\r\n\r\nThe darkspawn struck Red-Lion Hold. I heard the news in a tavern in Redcliffe. The Blight took the land. The Lady sends no messengers to blight-touched bodies. My kin will know no peace.\r\n\r\nI curse the Lady. I curse Korth. I curse all the gods who let Red-Lion fall. The people did the rites, sang the songs. Why would the gods abandon Red-Lion?\r\n\r\nI left the mercenaries I traveled with. They understood. Many have lost kin of their own to the Blight.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nSeveral more pages are illegible, and then:\r\n\r\nI have taken the survivors. I know how to travel better than they do. The thane is dead, but many warriors survive. Many people died from blight-sickness. Harof Talespinner was among them. Those who live say they asked the lowlanders for help, but they let Red-Lion die.\r\n\r\nWe must find a path. We have no need of Korth or the Lady, not if they would abandon my people like the lowlanders did. The only god I will forgive is Hakkon, for the tales say he was stolen by the lowlanders when the Jaws of Hakkon bound him to flesh and bone.\r\n\r\nRed-Lion Hold is gone. We are the Jaws of Hakkon now. We will build no home, for homes can die. Instead, we will bring Hakkon back and teach the lowlanders to fear the Avvar again.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThese appear to be somewhat recent pages from a journal:\r\n\r\nWe have searched for months and found nothing. The tales tell of this area, but the Stone-Bears, a hold of fishermen and chicken farmers, have lived here for generations and seen no sign. If we see nothing, we must keep moving. I will not let my hold falter. We will move on lest we die.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nAfter several torn-out pages, another section is legible:\r\n\r\nWe have found it. Hakkon himself welcomed us. An ancient Tevinter fortress, sheathed in a wall of ice. It was untouched by lowlanders, who could find no way to breach the walls. Our mages alone, blessed by Silent Hakkon with the gifts of ice, could part the wall for a few heartbeats, giving our people time to climb inside.\r\n\r\nThe wall resists common fire, and even the flames from our mages did little to melt the magical ice. We are safe. The northerner markers lead to a shrine that our mages say reeks of magic. I have sent warriors to guard it, lest it hold some spirit who can part this wall with lowlander magic.\r\n\r\nWe have found Hakkon, bound in silence where the lowland warrior trapped him for ages uncounted. Our trials have not been in vain. They were a test.\r\n\r\nHakkon will come again.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThese appear to be very recent pages from a journal:\r\n\r\nThe lowland warrior trapped our god in some strange magic the mages cannot understand. They say time is twisted upon itself, a knot inside a knot. They say it may be the old Tevinter magic of this place that made it possible, spirits and old Tevinter power like blood and wine.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Hakkon remains in the dragon. That much is clear. In the tales, the Jaws of Hakkon tamed it like a hold-beast, then fed it demonweed and other herbs the healers use to bring spirits. We cannot unravel the magic binding the dragon, but perhaps we can bring forth Hakkon himself and bind him anew to some other worthy beast.\r\n\r\nRed-Lion Hold&#39;s beast died with genlock blood in his jaws. It was a good death, but a death still. As Jaws of Hakkon, we have no hold-beast, but the soft-limbed fools at Stone-Bear Hold have one who is tamed and ready.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThe next several pages are illegible, until:\r\n\r\nThe winter-cursed Inquisition has come. The bear is free and our wall of ice shattered by Tevinter magic. We have no time and no beast.\r\n\r\nI will eat the herbs myself.

But while the Qunari have raised their own marvels on the island&mdash;the famed city of Qunandar comes to mind&mdash;Par Vollen had a rich history before the Qun ever came to its shores. Tear your eyes from Qunandar&#39;s wonders and look instead to the jungle. There you&#39;ll see the ruins of vast cities that proclaim in silence: &quot;We were here.&quot;\n\nPar Vollen&#39;s distinctive pyramids, looming from the overgrowth, have remained largely intact, even if their intended purpose has been lost. They do not seem to be tombs, though some chambers contain bodies that have been carefully preserved. Amazingly, the pyramids&#39; proportions are mathematically perfect. Since their alignment is so precise, one suspects they served some scientific purpose. Observatories, perhaps? Andvan Therastes has observed that the shape of the Par Vollen pyramids seems perfectly to match the constellation Solium.\n\nWe know more of the pyramids than we do of the humans who built them. The Qunari came to Par Vollen as conquerors, but there is no history and little sign of battles fought on the island&#39;s shores. A civilization that could build such vast cities would surely have defenses, armies, perhaps weapons alien even to the Qunari. So why is there so little proof of resistance?\n\nOne answer may lie in what remains of their temples. Beneath the leaves and vines covering the walls, you can still make out the stylized carvings that adorn them. The paint has long since flaked away, but the silhouettes are clear: intricate sea creatures, shipwrights, musicians, archers, and kings. Here and there, odd figures are depicted, tall, horned, always in a position of authority and respect.\n\nWhat were these horned figures to the ancients of Par Vollen? Priests, ritualistically crowned? Heroes? Gods, perhaps? We may never know the truth. But when the Qunari arrived from the sea, horned and carrying the word of the Qun, perhaps instead of conquerors, the people of Par Vollen saw an old legend returning to them.\n\nThis is all supposition.

It is understood that the Disciples were descendants of the first followers of Andraste, who brought her ashes to Ferelden and built the temple to house it. Because they had pledged themselves to the keeping of the Temple of Sacred Ashes, the Disciples of Andraste never left the Frostbacks. For nine hundred years, they kept strangers away, killing all who came close, and were completely oblivious to the world that advanced beyond the boundaries of their home.\n\nHaving developed separately from the traditions of the Andrastian Chantry, the Disciples were led by revered fathers. However, little else is known about the original beliefs of the Disciples, for they had turned from their noble heritage by the time they were discovered. Almost all scholars believe that the centuries-long isolation imposed upon the village led to the necessity for inbreeding. This practice likely led to a greater incidence of madness, which may explain why the cult was, at the time of its discovering in 9:30, worshipping a high dragon.\n\nAccording to writings discovered in Haven, the Disciples of Andraste showed reverence to the dragon, believing it to be the Prophet reborn. The egg clutches and dragonlings of the dragon were afforded great honor, for being &quot;Andraste&#39;s&quot; offspring, and were cared for by the cult. The dragon never attacked the cult, being cunning enough to recognize how this arrangement benefited it.\n\nIn 9:30 Dragon, the Disciples were wiped out by the Hero of Ferelden, who was on a quest to retrieve the Sacred Ashes of Andraste.\n\n&mdash;From Before Andrastianism: the Forgotten Faiths by Sister Rondwyn of Tantervale", "authors": "Sister Rondwyn"}, "21577": {"title": "Constellation: Kios", "text": "Referred to as &quot;Chaos&quot; in common parlance, the constellation Kios is thought to represent the Old God Zazikel.

Indeed, one of the few times an attempt to do so was as a play in the Grand Royeaux Theater that sharply criticized Divine Justinia&#39;s attempts at reform. The play was quickly banned after only three performances. A book titled The Three Brothers was later published in Minrathous, citing the exploits of three Tevinter brothers who find themselves lost in Val Royeaux and spend their time ridiculing Orlesian culture. Despite claims in Tevinter that it is the original, it&#39;s quite clear that the Three Sisters legend far predates it.\n\nThroughout the legend&#39;s various incarnations, the most commonly depicted adventures include:\n\n- The sisters are convinced to drink dwarven ale by a handsome nobleman with sinister intentions. Their reactions to the ale vary, but usually by the end of this tale, the sisters end up on a wild chase after the nobleman through the streets of the Belle Marche until he jumps into the river and drowns.\n\n- The sisters ask for help from a group of dwarven merchants, who say they will do so only if the sisters solve a clever riddle. The nature of the riddle varies, but the dwarves always cheat the sisters in the end. Typically, the encounter ends with the sisters fleeing before they are sold into slavery, though sometimes the legend has them clubbing the lead dwarf to death with paddles until the other dwarves run off.\n\n- They are drawn into the annual Satinalia parade, usually in the climax of the story, until the Imperial army descends upon the revelers and starts a chaotic chain reaction that results in the sisters either stowing aboard a pirate ship or wading through the elven alienage&#39;s sewers. It seems to change each age.\n\nOnce their chaperone, La B&ecirc;te, catches up with the girls, they usually hang their heads in shame and return to the Montebelliard manse to resume good and honest lives. Not always, however. The most recent versions of the legend have the sisters remaining in Val Royeaux to fight criminals while wearing black masks, though I honestly cannot tell where this comes from.\n\n&#x2500;&#x2500;From Tales of Val Royeaux by Lord Werner Jauquin", "authors": "Lord Werner Jauquin"}, "21579": {"title": "The Troubles of a Chantry Scholar", "text": "As students of culture, it is important to always recognize your biases. I wear my Chantry perspective openly, for if my readers do not understand the lens through which I view the world, they cannot account for how these biases may color my writing.\n\nGathering accurate information is challenging in a place as vast and fragmented as Thedas. One man may go on at length about lurid dealings with a king, then refuse to provide his name or some proof of the account. Other sources may conflict wildly. Fixing travel to some of the more remote areas of the continent is nothing compared to the difficulty I&#39;ve had finding contacts I can trust. I cannot tell you how many times &quot;reputable people&quot; have tried to deceive me, sometimes for personal notoriety, more often in the interest of a pet cause. Trustworthy Qunari, Dalish, and Tevinter contacts are especially scarce, and I prize those I have kept friendly. Often it is I who must earn their trust.\n\nTexts too can be unreliable. From extensive readings, I have determined that Andraste was a Fereldan Orlesian who was born in every town from here to Hossberg. What little remains of elven history has been told and retold, shifted and skewed, until the tales are unrecognizable. I have particular respect for the dwarves, for there is no other people so obsessed with recording an accurate and complete history. If only the Shapers were as open as the skies they fear.\n\nIf I can be honest, the long reign of the Chantry has made the recording of reality at times a trial. Most common histories have been rewritten through the filter of my religion. Everything has meaning as it pertains to the Maker. And while this is unavoidable, it sometimes leads to conflicts between what is officially taught by the Chantry and what I have seen with my own eyes.\n\nWhile my belief in the Maker is absolute, only a fool would ignore the lessons to be learned from other societies and religions.\n\nTake the Fade. Was it the kingdom of the Maker, as common knowledge dictates, or the realm of the Tevinter Old Gods? Few people would contest its existence, but beyond that, there is little agreement among scholars. Though there are many who would disagree with me, I have come to believe nothing is for certain.

It was a sanctuary dedicated to Andruil, goddess of the forest; the house was built around the ruins. The heart of the shrine was an etched stone altar, now in the grand hall. It&#39;s quite spectacular. Any noble in Val Royeaux would be envious of something with such historical significance. I planned a party to show off the house and its elven altar. We had it decorated with white flowers and candles, even brought in some harts to graze in the garden outside. The effect was stunning.\n\nThen, my stroke of genius! Remember when Lady Carine&#39;s pastime was reading about elves, and how sympathetic she was to what happened in the Dales? She couldn&#39;t stop talking about how we must make contact with the restless elven spirits. All her lady companions were so taken with the idea. Well, I did just that.

I had to hire a mage to help, of course&mdash;a very discreet fellow from Montsimmard.\n\nDuring the party, I talked about how the house was a haunt for sad elven spirits. They ate it all up. Romantic, they said. For the final touch, I had everyone join hands around the elven stone and pray, and the mage (no names!) cast a spell that made us dance like puppets on strings and sing &quot;The Little Bluebird of Summer.&quot;\n\nIt was a triumph!

The shifting nature of the Fade made the effort futile, and so much death left the magisters open to possession by demons.

As if on its own. With no traders or merchants or human farmers involved. A little miracle of dwarven ingenuity.\n\nThe reality is a lot messier than their fantasy.\n\nOrzammar relies upon the surface not just for its prosperity, but for its survival. Ages of Blights have taken thousands of thaigs away from the dwarves. These were the places where most of the food was raised. The dwarven kingdom that endured alone, independent beneath the Stone from time immemorial, perished in the First Blight, faded into myth. Now, the remaining dwarves underground cling to existence through a lifeline to the surface, a chain forged from the casteless.\n\nEvery dwarf who goes to the surface is stripped of caste, effectively exiled and removed from dwarven society forever. But Orzammar relies on continued relations with these exiles to live. This has created a shadowy area of dwarven trade and politics where the rich, powerful, and elite maintain secret ties to people who, by official decree, no longer exist. And everyone knows what kinds of things lurk in the shadows.\n\nThe Carta lives in the underbelly of the surface trade like a tapeworm. Many surface dwarves maintain ties&mdash;not officially recognized, of course, but respectable&mdash;to their former houses in the Noble or Merchant Castes, and those contacts are their means of trading with Orzammar. Those who have no ties, because they were cast off by their families or never had good connections, make the trip back underground to trade with Orzammar personally, where they find themselves treated like criminals. A casteless in Orzammar, even a wealthy one from the surface, will be driven away from most merchants, treated like he&#39;s carrying a plague at best. So these surface merchants turn to the Carta for help. The Carta acts as a contact in Orzammar for surface businesses and sells their goods on the black market. For a cut, of course. The Carta always gets its cut.\n\nThe outraged citizens of Orzammar sometimes petition the Assembly to deal with the rampant crime surrounding the black market, and showy displays are made of kicking in the doors to Carta hideouts and razing Dust Town. But the Carta always comes back, because the Assembly always allows it. Too much of Orzammar is dependent on the black market trade, and the nobles know it. They all do business with the Carta.

This is due, I should think, to a general lack of knowledge regarding Andraste&#39;s mortal life. Understandable, considering the many cults that arose following her death. Every one sought to claim Our Lady for their own culture or claimed some aspect of her existence was a lie&mdash;all of them complete fabrications. My order has done considerable research to ascertain the truth.\n\nWe all know Andraste and the Betrayer raised five children. The eldest three were sons: Isorath, Evrion, and Verald. The rule of what was once southern Tevinter was split among them. Isorath was given the west, what is today Orlais. Evrion was given the east, what is today the Free Marches. Verald was given the central Planasene, what is today Nevarra. What became of these men and their legacies is the stuff of legend, and the majority of claimants to Andraste&#39;s bloodline link back to one of them. None of the three sons, however, were born of Andraste. They were born of the Betrayer&#39;s concubine, Gilivhan. People choose to overlook the fact that Andraste came from the Alamarri tribesmen and that they were barbarians, not the Fereldans we know today. They were savage warriors who took concubines in addition to their wives, and because Andraste was thought to be too weak to bear children, the Betrayer took Gilivhan to provide him heirs. Which she did. After her death, the sons were raised as Andraste&#39;s own.\n\nLater in life, Andraste proved predictions wrong and had two daughters by the Betrayer: Ebris and Vivial. They were kept out of the public eye and not permitted to marry, though both had consorts. Ebris had but one child, Alli Vemar, who perished on a voyage to Denerim&mdash;less than a month after her mother fell to plague, and without children of her own. The younger daughter, Vivial, was more controversial: a strong-headed woman who defied her family by falling in love with a mage of Tevinter, Regulan. Vivial and Regulan went into self-imposed exile as the Exalted March began, and into hiding following Andraste&#39;s betrayal and murder.\n\nWhat became of Vivial and her descendants is largely unknown for one primary reason: she had only daughters. Each of those daughters only had daughters. They married into other families and took other names, and in the chaos of the Second Blight, all traces of survivors were lost. Andraste&#39;s true bloodline, if it exists, lies solely in the descendants of Vivial, and the suspicion of my order is that it produces only daughters.

Now, what would be considered a cult in a society that worshipped the Old Gods? An order of magisters who believed in the destruction of the Magisterium, the governing body of the Imperium that determines which mages are and are not given the &quot;magister&quot; title. The members of this order wished to return to an earlier period where Dreamers ruled, and evidence indicates they operated throughout Tevinter, though primarily in the frontier areas. There they would lock away their secrets, caches of treasure, and perhaps even secret meeting places (though we have no way of knowing for certain), unlockable only through knowledge of ancient astronomy&mdash;a practice that was, we understand, rather out of fashion in the late Tevinter period.\n\nAccording to our investigations, each of the astrariums could point to the secret cache if one knew the three constellations that mapped to each device present at the site. Connect the dweomers in the correct configuration, and it would be revealed. Many of these relics were sought out by Andrastian cultists in the early Divine Age (the Order of Fiery Promise in particular) and destroyed. Why? Because they believed the astrariums held together the Veil, and that destroying them would destroy the Veil and thus the world.

It finds its way into your soul, and once it gets there, you carry it always.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting behind them, casting long shadows from the tavern down to the water. A flock of cormorants took advantage of the fading light to dive for fish making their way back out to sea.\r\n\r\n&quot;Maybe so.&quot; Donnen smiled, too. &quot;But the world can always use a Champion or a guardsman wherever they happen to go.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe gentleman raised his tankard. &quot;I&#39;ll drink to that.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd the two men watched the last of the light disappear in peace.\r\n\r\n<i>If female Hawke was left behind in the Fade...</i>\r\n\r\nHe poured a glass of red Orlesian wine and carried it out to the patio where Lady Marielle sat, playing a lute for the benefit of a distant flock of cormorants and a sleepy mabari hound.\r\n\r\nDonnen handed her the glass with a smile. &quot;Can I get you anything else, your ladyship?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you, guardsman.&quot; Marielle set aside her lute; the sleepy hound looked up, annoyed at having its lullaby interrupted.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#39;s just Donnen these days,&quot; he replied, looking out over the waves. &quot;My time in the Kirkwall guard is over.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Is it?&quot; She smiled slyly over the glass. &quot;You don&#39;t think naming a tavern The Watch was a sign that perhaps you can take the guardsman out of Kirkwall, and even out of the Guard, but he never... quite leaves?&quot;\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting behind them. The hound stretched and ambled over to the table to lay his head on Lady Marielle&#39;s knee and beg for table scraps. In the distance, the cormorants took off in a single motion to return to their roosts up the shore.\r\n\r\nDonnen smiled back. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re right. But tonight I&#39;m off duty, your ladyship.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Marielle,&quot; she corrected. &quot;And to answer your question, you can get me some company. One guardsman might suffice.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd the two of them watched the last of the light disappear together in peace.\r\n\r\n<i>If Alistair was left behind in the Fade...</i>\r\n\r\nHe poured a glass of smoky Fereldan whisky and carried it out to the patio where a sandy-haired fellow was attempting to play the lute. Or murder the lute. Or murder the concept of music itself. It probably didn&#39;t help that the man was holding the lute straight out in front of him as if he feared it were a snake that might bite him.\r\n\r\nDonnen offered the fellow the glass, fervently hoping it would make the playing stop.\r\n\r\n&quot;Guardsman! You came to my rescue just in time!&quot; The blond man took the glass with a sheepish laugh and all but threw the lute into a nearby chair.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#39;s just Donnen these days,&quot; he replied, looking out over the waves. &quot;My time in the Kirkwall guard is over.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Retirement is grand, isn&#39;t it? No more responsibility, no more senior officers yelling at you, no more Kirkwall...&quot; The other man looked wistfully out at the birds diving into the waves down the coast.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting behind them, turning the Amaranthine Ocean a deep sapphire and sending the seabirds back up the cliffs to their nests.\r\n\r\n&quot;Kirwall&#39;s still out there. Along with all those other things. I just didn&#39;t bring them to the bar.&quot; Donnen grinned. &quot;So what did you retire from?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you.&quot; The man gave him a lopsided grin in return. &quot;You want to hear a badly told story about a bastard prince with an unholy love of cheese?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Why not? We&#39;ve got time.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd while the blond man spun his unlikely tale, the two of them watched the last of the light vanish in peace.\r\n\r\n<i>If Loghain was left behind in the Fade...</i>\r\n\r\nHe poured the last dregs of a pale Fereldan larger into a mug and headed out to the patio where an old soldier sat strumming a particularly battered-looking lute.\r\n\r\nDonnen held out the mug like a peace offering.\r\n\r\n&quot;Thank you, guardsman.&quot; The soldier set aside the lute in favor of the mug with a businesslike efficiency. The grizzled mabari curled up at his feet flicked one ear, dreaming.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#39;s just Donnen these days,&quot; He replied, looking out over the waves. &quot;My time in the Kirkwall guard is over.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Is it?&quot; the soldier sighed, looking down at the sleeping dog. &quot;If you don&#39;t still wake up from dreams about patrols, you&#39;re luckier than most.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe sun slipped down another notch in the sky behind them, and the wind coming in off the sea turned cooler.\r\n\r\n&quot;You know what I miss?&quot; Donnen said. &quot;The smell of the Lowtown Bazaar in the morning. Two dozen bakeries with loaves of bread and sweet pies in the oven.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;There are worse things,&quot; the soldier laughed, &quot;to remember about home than the smell of pies baking.&quot; Then he sighed again. &quot;You really are luckier than most.&quot;\r\n\r\nDonnen smiled. &quot;Maybe so.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe old soldier raised his mug. &quot;Here&#39;s to home.&quot;\r\n\r\nAt his feet, the hound twitched her paws, chasing rabbits in her sleep, and the last light faded from the sky in peace.", "authors": "Varric Tethras"}, "21641": {"title": "A Season of the Four Afoul", "text": "At this window, the thief Treadwell did witness the attempted assault of Lady Castine.

He believed the best way to achieve this was through fear&mdash;after all, those who feared him would never cross him or question his rule. Most importantly, those who feared him would always seek to please him.\n\nBedwyr cultivated terror in his subordinates through the gleeful and unrestrained use of a contraption referred to as &quot;the maiden.&quot; The maiden was a hinged iron casket, as high and wide and deep as a man, with vicious spikes within, meant to pierce through the poor soul locked into it. Bedwyr&#39;s maiden was a prized possession, and stood in a place of honor in his throne room, often with a screaming victim inside it. Political rivals, suspected assassins, treasonous ministers&mdash;the maiden consumed them all. But as time passed, more people were given to the maiden for increasingly trivial offenses: the cook for over-salting the king&#39;s food, the pageboy for dropping his sword. The maiden cast a pall over the kingdom, and its people prayed for deliverance from their cruel king.\n\nThen one day, a strange woman rode into the city. She called herself Ember, and was an emissary from a far-off land. Her leaders had heard, she said, of Bedwyr&#39;s wisdom and authority, and she sought the king&#39;s counsel. The thought that he had earned the adulation of brother-kings across the sea made Bedwyr swell with pride, and he granted Ember an audience.\n\nThey dined and danced, and through it all, Ember flattered and fawned on the king. At the end of the night, Ember asked to see the maiden, the infamous device that had given Bedwyr all his power. The king, giddy with praise, proudly presented Ember with the empty contraption. Ember looked at the maiden, sighed with disappointment and said, &quot;That does not look terrifying at all. I should have imagined the spikes to be much sharper.&quot;\n\nBedwyr grew red at her comment and replied: &quot;The spikes are sharp enough. Look at the blood that still clings to them!&quot;\n\n&quot;But it is so small,&quot; said Ember. &quot;Are only children and women its victims?&quot;\n\nBedwyr grew redder still, and replied, &quot;Of course not. The maiden has devoured many men.&quot;\n\nEmber shook her head and said to the king, &quot;I do not believe it. Surely no warrior could fear this thing. A man like yourself, tall and muscled, would not fit within.&quot;\n\nThe king laughed, and saw a way to prove the merit of the maiden to Ember. &quot;I will show you how easily a man like myself could fit,&quot; he said. And with that, he stepped into the device. But Ember was waiting, and no sooner had Bedwyr squeezed himself into the iron casket that Ember slammed it shut on him.\n\nEmber took the maiden, with the screaming Bedwyr inside, through the castle, and down into the city. And the people, finally free from the king&#39;s tyranny, cheer and danced to the &quot;singing&quot; that echoed through the streets, until Bedwyr was dead and it finally stopped.\n\n&mdash;A tale often told in the Singing Maiden tavern", "authors": "Unknown [Dragon Age]"}, "21643": {"title": "In the Mists: The Windline Marcher", "text": "The story of the &quot;Windline Marcher&quot; is an old one.

A sentry from Hightown spots her floating in the mists, her sails full though there is no wind. Boats are launched, but no matter how far out to sea they go, they are unable to reach the &quot;Marcher.&quot; Finally, the ship recedes into the mists and is gone. From that day on, she is spotted by sailors on the Waking Sea, always though mists and always before a storm, and is said to herald a violent death for all who see her.\n\nOf course, the legend of the &quot;Windline Marcher&quot; is often dismissed as superstition, and in recent years the sighting of phantasmal vessels was proven to be nothing more than a trick of light upon the water. Still, the story continues to be told, its intent to chill, amuse, or even titillate. As a consequence, the tale has grown more colorful over time. In many later versions, the &quot;Marcher&quot; is manned by a crew of stunningly beautiful spirits, who can fulfill one&#39;s deepest (carnal) desires, should one succeed in boarding the ship.

For in the Orlais of the time, the mask was the person, and the wearer must be he, even if their build is slight and their sex reversed. Could it not be a test? In exposing the mistake, is not the witness also a cause of violation?\n\nTwo.\n\nAnd so it was that this visiting servant was not just greeted but whisked away, for this was not a mere fete, but the launching of a grand operation. And at the fore of the might of Orlais now stood a waif behind a general&#39;s face. And none did question, for fear of censure. And she, the servant, could not get away. Left without her lord, she feared the madness of the Orlesians. That if she removed the mask, they would call her imposter, or spy, or some other thing she could not know. And as enemy battalions marched upon them, the servant was certain it would end in death for all.\n\nThree.\n\nBut during times of crisis, there can emerge abilities we do not know we possess. The servant, under the greatest duress, stood as Not-Sheritan. She stood, and she spoke. She stood, and she led. She stood, and she attacked. And under banners they knew and a voice they did not, the forces of Orlais brought low their enemy. Now, perhaps the servant was more lieutenant than page to her battle-hardened lord. And perhaps the strength of the foe is stressed too much in retellings. And perhaps the allied were well practiced in their roles. But none question that Not-Sheritan was at the least adequate and at the most inspirational.\n\nFour.\n\nAnd so it was that victory was absolute, and cheers were raised for General Not-Sheritan. And so buoyed by respect and admiration, Not-Sheritan stood proud and removed the mask to state her true name. For had they not accepted her? Had they not thrived by her leadership? Had they not become comrades despite station and masks and nonsense of protocol? And the answer was swift and bewildering, for they had not. And swiftly she was bundled away, amid calls of &quot;Imposter!&quot; and &quot;Spy!&quot; and other terms she could not know. For she still did not know Orlais.\n\nFive.\n\nIn the days that followed, to avoid scandal the appointing of Not-Sheritan was claimed a grand tactic of the true general, who must have orchestrated the whole affair from secret. &quot;From secret&quot; meaning the cloakroom, for not even his own attendants knew his face, and they would have had the guard whisk him to jail for trespassing. But with his mask restored and wary of the embarrassment, the general was merciful with Not-Sheritan, imposing less than half the prescribed lashes and sparing her and her lord the gallows. They were allowed to leave Orlais on the condition that &quot;Not-Sheritan&quot; was henceforth her name.", "authors": "Unknown [Dragon Age]"}, "21654": {"title": "The Crows and Queen Madrigal", "text": "The first Crow refused to speak, even when we put hot coals to the soles of his feet and peeled the skin off his face and hands with a paring knife.

Her body was later found with four steel swords through the chest. I asked what he knew about one of the four swords being a replica of Hessarian&#39;s Sword of Mercy. He had not heard about that, or at least claimed as much. He later died on the rack, smiling slightly.\n\nThe third Crow must have realized he would not leave the dungeon alive. He seemed to hope that by angering Master Fiore, he would earn himself a quick death. The Crow tried our patience with pithy comments while Master Fiore was trying to work. At one point, he made a remark about Fiore&#39;s mother, which I shall not repeat here. I will admit to feeling admiration for his ability to retain a capacity for coherent speech, and even some wit, while under extreme duress.\n\nAmid all his useless chatter, this third Crow did raise an important point.

While a relatively rare distinction, it seems almost any achievement of significance warrants the title. Some Paragons are the victors of great battles. Others write books or songs. The only common thread is an act that betters or sustains the dwarven way of life in some notable fashion.\n\nAeducan is among the oldest and perhaps most famous Paragons. Not to be confused with his descendent, King Endrin Aeducan, this prior Aeducan was a humble member of the Warrior Caste whose brave leadership during the First Blight saved Orzammar. When other thaigs were lost, Aeducan claimed defeated&mdash;but his service made him a hero.

Caridin, a master smith, created the powerful golems who helped the dwarves immeasurably in their battle with the darkspawn. Caridin then disappeared amid much speculation, taking the secret of his craft with him.\n\nThere is also Astyth the Grey, a Paragon of the Warrior Caste. She was famous for her skills in unarmed combat and cut out her own tongue to focus on the art without distraction. An order of female dwarven warriors known as the Silent Sisters persists; they remove their tongues in her honor.\n\nBut these are the most well known of the dwarven Paragons.

Every actor wears a mask, and every mask follows a hierarchy of shape and colors that indicates to the audience the character&#39;s importance. Half-face green masks indicate a leading male role, for example, while half-face purple masks are for primary female characters. Full white masks are reserved for roles of no clear gender, such as spirits, except for demons, whose masks must always be black and red. Further complicating matters for those new to Orlesian theater, an actor&#39;s race or sex has no bearing on the parts they can play.\r\n\r\nIf a director believes they can sell the part, men can play dowagers, women can play dukes, and even an elf can play a king. Once donned, the mask is understood to be absolutely them. None of the actors I spoke to could explain to me the history behind this tradition, but bristled when I suggested other nations find it strange. There is a strong bond of trust between Orlesian theater troupes and their viewers. Indeed, I have rarely attended such attentive audiences than in Val Royeaux. It is my guess that Orlesians, surrounded as they are by masks in their daily lives, both require and fully respect a place where the objects boldly display their wearers&#39; intentions for a change.\r\n\r\nAn appendix at the back of this volume lists the appearance and meanings of Orlais&#39; theatrical masks. These conventions are vital to understanding the history of its finest theater, a journey I hope you will find as rewarding as I have.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From A Compendium of Orlesian Theater, Volume I: Introduction by Magister Pellinar\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA tent. King Drakon turns his crown in his hands.\r\nEnter his trusted cousin, Captain Ashan.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ashan: Hail, Your Majesty. The armies wait on you.\r\n\r\nKing Drakon: What of the enemy?\r\n\r\nCaptain Ashan: The blighted ones mass on the hill, in larger numbers than ever we&#39;ve seen.\r\n\r\nKing Drakon: We are outmatched on the field.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ashan: Andraste armed us with faith.\r\n\r\nKing Drakon: Our allies are a week from Cumberland.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ashan: We are aided by the Maker&#39;s word.\r\n\r\nKing Drakon: I do not doubt.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ashan: Yet your brow is vexed.\r\n\r\nDrakon throws down his crown.\r\n\r\nKing Drakon: Pride killed our Prophet. Her sacred words are all we&#39;ve left! If victory spurns us, who will carry them forward? Who will bear the Chant of Light?\r\n\r\nCaptain Ashan: Cousin! The army waits!\r\n\r\nKing Drakon: Maker, for a soul fit to lead them!\r\n\r\n&mdash;From The Sword of Drakon: an Examination of the Life and History of the Father of Orlais, by Marquise Freyette\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s little wonder King Drakon&#39;s life is one of the most popular tales in Orlais. After founding both Orlais and the Chantry, the charismatic young noble battled the Second Blight for the rest of his reign. Freyette&#39;s plays are notable for being the first to portray Orlais&#39; founder as a man beset by doubts, as are we all, instead of an idealized cipher. A few grand clerics attempted to ban the play, saying it criticized the current state of the Chantry, but The Sword of Drakon proved too popular among the masses and the nobility and remains a staple of Orlesian theater to this day.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From A Compendium of Orlesian Theater, Volume II: Classics of the Storm Age by Magister Pellinar\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nCountess Dionne: You mock me.\r\n\r\nDuke Le Seuille: It&#39;s what I do best, I&#39;m told.\r\n\r\nCountess Dionne: He cannot be our child!\r\n\r\nDuke Le Seuille: I have asked about the town. He wears my great-grandfather&#39;s scabbard. The one that went missing that night.\r\n\r\nCountess Dionne: Impossible.\r\n\r\nDuke Le Seuille: Then you have no objections to our visitor?\r\n\r\nCountess Dionne: Who else have you informed of this?\r\n\r\nA woman in a black and gold mask with crow feathers on the side enters from the servant&#39;s door. She bows. The countess pales and puts her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nCountess Dionne: But if the man come to visit the castle is our son&mdash;\r\n\r\nDuke Le Seuille: As you said, he cannot be. For both our sakes.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From The Heir of Verchiel by Paul Legrand\r\n\r\nRife with betrayal, revenge, and a thundering climax, The Heir of Verchiel is performed each year in the city that gave it its name, a lavish production put on for the nobility who visit from nearby Halamshiral. The first performance of the play featured the noted actor Victor Boyet as the Duke Le Seuille. A city elf from Val Royeaux, Boyet took smaller roles for five years before convincing Legrand he was fit for the part. His first performance in the capital was so well received that when the cast came out to thunderous applause, the current emperor rose from his seat when Boyet took the stage.\r\n\r\nElves have done well in Orlais&#39; theaters, much to the surprise of those outside the country, but actors&#39; lives are hotbeds of scandal and intrigue that would make even the bards blush. It is unusual at first to see elves openly tolerated and sometimes even welcomed into their betters&#39; circles, but Orlais treats its actors as a breed apart.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From A Compendium of Orlesian Theater, Volume III: Tragedies in the Modern Style by Magister Pellinar\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nThe Young Maiden: Come, my lord, let us dance!\r\n\r\nThe Mayor: No! No, I cannot.\r\n\r\nThe Young Maiden: Oh, I beseech thee, do not leave me without a dance!\r\n\r\nThe Mayor: I have imbibed too much!\r\n\r\nThe Young Maiden: Please, come dance! I must leave soon!\r\n\r\nThe Mayor: It&#39;s too much! I bet you leave me to my circumspection!\r\n\r\nLaughing, the woman pulls the mayor up from his seat. A loud sound stops her.\r\n\r\nThe Young Maiden: Do I smell the cook&#39;s cabbage stew from noon?\r\n\r\nThe Mayor: It has rejoined us, alas, from a more southerly direction.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From Wilkshire Downs by A. Pourri\r\n\r\nThis play enjoys enduring and, some might say, embarrassing popularity, never failing to draw a large crowd during a festival or market. The fictional Fereldan village of Wilkshire Downs is the setting for over three thousand lines of increasingly outrageous situations begun, worsened, or ended by flatulence.\r\n\r\nI am told actors go on a special diet to convincingly play the roles. I&#39;ve not the courage for details.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From A Compendium of Orlesian Theater, Volume IV: Comedies and Operettas by Magister Pellinar\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nCallista paces on the battlement over the lake. The sky is dark. She holds a cup of poison. Camallia is there, face veiled.\r\n\r\nCallista: The dawn is late.\r\n\r\nCamallia: It will not come again.\r\n\r\nCallista: It must hide &#39;neath the clouds.\r\n\r\nCamallia: It will not come again.\r\n\r\nCallista: The queen thinks you dead.\r\n\r\nCamallia, her back to the audience, faces Callista, and removes her veil.\r\n\r\nCallista moans in fear. She drops her cup.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From The Setting of the Light by Lumiere Bartlet\r\n\r\nThese lines are from a play said to have been one of the strangest works of its time. Bartlet was a writer of small repute who died when a fire swept through his pauper&#39;s hovel. The Setting of the Light takes place in the mysterious city of Demhe, implied to be another world that somehow becomes our own moon. Accidents, madness, and suicide plagued the first production, and some historians claim that the play&#39;s conclusion was at once so hauntingly beautiful and shockingly vile it sparked the Great Riot of Val Royeaux in 4:52 Black.\r\n\r\nThe truth will forever be a mystery. Only fourteen pages of the play remain.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From A Compendium of Orlesian Theater, Volume V: Lost or Fragmented Works by Magister Pellinar\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nLady Cramoisi: The body is not yet cold. Someone in this mansion killed Lord Carcasse!\r\n\r\nBlanche, the Chambermaid: Maker&#39;s mercy! There&#39;s a murderer among us?\r\n\r\nCaptain Dore: Andraste take it, the woman&#39;s right. How do we proceed?\r\n\r\nMother Emeraude: We must search for some hint as to how the foul deed was done.\r\n\r\nCaptain Dore: With gusto, if one goes by the amount of blood on the walls.\r\n\r\nBlanche faints.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From Death in the Mansion by Violette Armand\r\n\r\nIncredibly, this enjoyable if somewhat predictable melodrama begat a storm of debate. At the end of the piece, the murderer of Lord Carcasse changes into a villain&#39;s mask before giving an elaborate confessional speech. At the time, masks in Orlesian theater were fixed to each role. Plays were written with the assumption that the masks gave audiences vital information a play&#39;s characters might not possess. Death in the Mansion ignored this implicit contract, shocking the audiences at the time.\r\n\r\nArmand was nearly destroyed by the attacks on Death in the Mansion by both her theatergoers and Orlesian critics. Many accused her of an unforgivable violation of the spirit of the theater. A vogue for &quot;False Face&quot; stories caught on among the foremost writers of the time, however, and today Armand&#39;s techniques are seen as wholly unremarkable. It only goes to show how easily the alchemy of time shifts the outrageous into the everyday.\r\n\r\n&mdash;From A Compendium of Orlesian Theater, Volume VI: The Plays of False Faces by Magister Pellinar", "authors": "Magister Pellinar"}, "21670": {"title": "Shred of Blue", "text": "Hear the rain upon the leaves, above the sky lies grey.\r\nA shred of blue would be denied.

Typically, one&#39;s sexual habits are considered natural and separate from matters of procreation, and only among the nobility, where procreation involves issues of inheritance and the union of powerful families, is it considered of vital importance. Yet, even there, a noble who has done their duty to the family might be allowed to pursue their own sexual interests without raising eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe view on indulging lusts with a member of the same gender varies from land to land. In Orlais, it is considered a quirk of character and nothing more. In Ferelden, it is a matter of scandal if done indiscreetly but otherwise nothing noteworthy.

Shortly after the Blight ended, Isabela's ship was caught in a storm near the Wounded Coast. The vessel was destroyed, and Isabela feels lucky to have escaped with her life. Now she's stranded in the Free Marches, spending most of her time in the Hanged Man tavern.\r\n\r\nIsabela also reveals that she was born in Rivain, but spent many years in Antiva.

She believes that it's still in Kirkwall, though why she thinks so is a mystery. Despite her insistence that she's keeping a low profile to avoid her old employer, Castillon, Isabela seems to go out of her way to cause trouble. Recently, one of her duels evolved into a bar brawl that then spilled out into Lowtown. Involving over twenty people, the fracas caused a great deal of damage to several merchant stalls.\r\n\r\nIsabela spent the next two weeks in the brig. Guard-Captain Aveline allowed her release, but not before extracting a promise\u2014that Isabela would not duel on public property again.
