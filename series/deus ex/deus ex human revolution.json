Doctor Dobelle is a doctor from New York whose specialty is in designing artificial organs. Several years ago, he embarked a project to implement an artificial eye which could transmit information straight into the occipital lobe of the brain. (For those of you still new to neuroscience, the occipital lobe is one of four lobes in the human brain. It is located at the back of the head and is responsible mostly for our visual processing.)\n\nThe goal for Dr. Dobelle was to create an implant with an electrode array and surgically insert it onto the surface of the occipital lobe&#39;s visual cortex. This way, the camera could transmit straight to the brain instead of to the eye, and hopefully create a more complex image than what can be achieved by a retinal implant. The procedure was very costly to perform, costing approximately $80,000. After working hard to raise money, an experimental patient who had lost his vision 20 years prior was finally able to undergo it. So, after allowing this patient ten days in recovery, Dr. Dobelle attempted to stimulate the electrodes which were now attached to the surface of his visual cortex.", "authors": "Hugh Darrow"}, "24666": {"title": "MY DIARY", "text": "***\n\nI am so tired of this place.

Reed et al, and incorporates the mutagenic chemical composition first revealed in her Patient X study.)\n\nTissue samples taken from both composites were tested every seven (7) days for rejection markers routinely associated with the onset of DDS (Darrow Deficiency Syndrome).\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nWithin three (3) weeks of testing, COMPOSITE 1 exhibited low levels of cytotoxic-M and DDS-Y enzymes commonly associated with the onset of Rejection Syndrome. The quantity of these enzymes increased as expected, with 20cc of Neuropozyne being administered in WEEK5 to break down glial tissue buildup around the biochip cluster.\n\nCOMPOSITE 2, on the other hand, showed no sign of either enzyme appearing until WEEK 6. At this point, trace levels of c-M were detected, but DISAPPEARED in subsequent weeks. This leads me to hypothesize that the enzymes were actually a byproduct of the formation of newly extruded neural tissue, compatible with the original matrix, forming around the PEDOT-cluster.*\n\n* Additional tests must be conducted to confirm this. Luckily, David informs me that new tissue from Patient X has become available in recent months.", "authors": "Unknown[Deus Ex] "}, "24664": {"title": "Human Powered - Autonomous Energy Reclamation Systems", "text": "Excerpt from an article first published in The New Cybernetics & Robotics Journal (Feb/March Edition, 2016).<br /><br />But of course, it's pointless designing these kinds of desktop wonders if the actual device is incapable of operating in the real world, without recourse to an infinite supply of battery packs or power generation vectors. What powers the human machine? That's where must look in order to power the next generation of cybernetic augmentation technologies - until such times as we can create small, light weight energy cells capable of running far beyond the lifetime of our products, we fall short.<br /><br />An energy conversion device is the answer; on the scale we're capable of manufacturing now, I'm confident we can create a unit small enough to be implanted, powerful enough to make the best use of chemical energy found in a human body. We do this by mimicking the human digestive process, improving upon the natural method of nutrient conversion from, say a liquid slurry - perhaps some form of organic protein matrix - directly to chemical potential; the capability also exists to derive neurochemical-specific energy signifiers.", "authors": "Hugh Darrow"}, "24668": {"title": "Hearts of Steel", "text": "<b>Iron & Shadows</b><br /><br />Across the plaza, Meredith saw him stumble and fall against a low wall.

Those eyes narrowed. \"You're hurt...\"<br /><br />\"Just a scratch,\" she began, but his hand was already coming up to her cheek.<br /><br />Meredith started as silver fingers touched her skin.

So forgive me, for a moment, if I take the time to explain a lot of information most of you already know.<br /><br />Light within our visual spectrum travels through space in the form of photons, or light waves. Our eyes are designed to receive these photons and then transmit to the brain the \"visual\" information coming to us from the environment. First the light passes through our pupils, then through the lens and finally to the back of the eye - where we find the retina. At the retina there are layers of photoreceptors - rods and cones. Cones are responsible for detecting different colors of light, and rods are responsible for our low light vision.<br /><br />In a person with a degenerative eye condition, such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration, the eye's photoreceptors die off, leaving him or her no longer able to detect light or see. The areas in the brain for visual processing are still intact, however, so people are still able to imagine vision. Because these brain areas are still intact, information can still be transmitted and visual perception can occur.<br /><br />And that is where neuro-enhancement of vision can begin.<br /><br />Part II<br /><br />Today's retinal implants are designed to partially restore useful vision to people who have lost their sight due to degenerative eye conditions. The device consists of an electrode array attached to the eye's retina; a digital camera worn on the user's body (usually attached to a pair of glasses); and a transmitter and receiver that converts images to electrical impulses. These impulses are then transmitted by radio frequency to the electrode array.<br /><br />At the moment, there are two types of retinal implants available: epiretinal implants and subretinal implants. The only difference between the two is at what point the electrode array stimulates the cells that would attach to photoreceptors. The signal transmitted travels to the optic nerve and then to the brain, allowing for the perception of sight. However, the vision a person receives from these implants is very rudimentary. He or she may be able to see an image similar to a scoreboard made up of large lights, or detect something come from light that is only an arm's length away.<br /><br />In other words, today's retinal implant gives the patient very limited vision. For a person who is going blind, it's a very good option for retaining some sense of vision. Still, we at Darrow Industries intend to improve it.", "authors": "Hugh Darrow"}, "24678": {"title": "Blurring The Boundaries between Man and Machine", "text": "Excerpted from a talk given by Hugh Darrow at the 2001 International Gathering of Neuroscientific Researchers.\n\nFor a mechanical bioprosthesis to work, a patient must be implanted with a device that powers its electronics. The problem is, generating power requires chemicals which are toxic to the body. So unless we find a way to harness electricity that is already present in the central nervous system, we are bound to fail.\n\nThere is a second problem, as well. Preliminary research into power-harnessing biochips suggests that our immune systems will perceive these devices as foreign invaders, and immediately send proteins to encapsulate them. Over time, scar tissue will build up between the PHB and surrounding tissue, resulting in neuroprosthesis failure. So how do we avoid this?\n\nDarrow Industries is working on a plan to &ldquo;grow&rdquo; networks of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) electrodes--PEDOT, if you will--that intertwine with neural cells.

A core unit -- a central governor, if you will -- works in concert with a series of distributed sub-modules implanted at key nerve junctions in the user's limbs and elsewhere among the implantee's vestibular structure; these in turn co-ordinate wirelessly with a strata of bio-plastic discs located along the lines of the spine. As the neuromuscular facilitator module 'beds in' to the implantee's neural pattern and becomes a functioning part of the user's body, experience will allow them to increase electrical neuron stimuli beyond initial states, and thus raise the levels of corporeal control, sensory function, and agility to even greater heights.", "authors": "Hugh Darrow"}, "24684": {"title": "Invasive Brain Machine Interfaces", "text": "Excerpt from an article in Neuroprosthetics Journal Quarterly (Fall 2012).<br /><br />Invasive Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs), which are most common in North American research, differ mainly from EEG-based interfaces by the method through which neural activity is recorded. While EEGs can record neural activity from outside the skull, invasive BMIs require the implantation of an electrode within the brain itself. In principle, invasive BMIs rely on the hypothesis that groups of neurons will modulate their activity in very similar ways each time a given action is performed, though individual neuron firing varies from trial to trial. A clinically viable BMI should be able to document these modulations and use these modulatory behaviors to reproduce motor actions in artificial actuators (Lebedev, 2006).<br /><br />In the 1960s and 70s, the scientist Eberhard E. Fetz and his colleagues trained monkeys to coordinate activity of their cortical neurons through biofeedback readings from implanted electrodes. Later, Edward Schmidt proposed that cortical neural activity could move a prosthetic, such as a robotic arm. Due to limitations in technological development, such as the technology necessary to implant sufficient quantities of electrodes into the brain, it took nearly twenty years for researchers to test his hypothesis.<br /><br />In the mid-90s, invasive BMI testing progressed from mice moving a device with a single degree of freedom to primate movement reproduction. In monkeys, researchers were able to produce \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreaching\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actualization, in which the neural action of the primate was able to stimulate a robotic arm to feed itself, combining components such as reaching and grasping into a fluid movement (Lebedev, 2006 ).", "authors": "Hugh Darrow"}, "24685": {"title": "Brain Implants", "text": "Comments by Hugh Darrow on a panel at the 2009 International Gathering of Neuroscientific Researchers\n\nI&#39;m firmly convinced that neurostimulation technology can evolve to a level where it will not only aid those with neural dysfunction, but actually enhance the cognition of normal people.\n\nThis mechanism, a network of platinum iridium electrodes connected to a subcutaneously implanted pulse generator in either a titanium or g-loop coated capsule, has previously been used to suppress the effects of Parkinson&#39;s disease, dystonia and other neurological conditions.

Since there are no pain neural fibers in the brain, the operation is performed while the patient is awake. When the electrode is inserted in the proper location, the tremors stop instantly.<br /><br />Unfortunately, metal electrodes are stiffer than surrounding brain tissue, and also prone to the mechanical impacts encountered by the body. Thus, when implanted in tissue, they frequently produce inflammation and sheaths of glial tissue surrounding them, a situation which not only leads to tissue injury, but also reduces electrical effectiveness of the device.<br /><br />PEDOT electrodes were a revolutionary improvement in that they relied on both conducting polymers and live neural cells in their design.

This is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the opposite direction, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. The system also manipulates the vestibular system within the inner ear.\n\nIn other words, by electrically stimulating afferent neurons, the system replaces absent sensory function by providing stimulation that modulates above and below a baseline.

This process of longterm potentiation was further explored in a series of studies in the mid-90s at Southern Illinois University&mdash;studies which clearly showed how memories could be enhanced by manipulating neuroplasticity.\n\nIndeed, with the precise timing available to us in today&#39;s computers, we can clearly see that enhancement in learning can be applied for areas of the motor cortex, auditory cortex, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus.

In one test involving 4 patients, he stimulated points in the amygdala and hippocampus to produce a variety of effects, including \"pleasant sensations, elation, deep, thoughtful concentration, odd feelings, super relaxation, colored visions, and other responses.\"<br /><br />Delgado later stated that \"brain transmitters can remain in a person's head for life.

They are the most widely used neuroprosthetics in the U.S.<br /><br />In order to understand how a cochlear implant works, one must first understand the how the human ear works. Sound waves travel through the air and are funneled into the auditory canal by the pinna - the outer part of the ear that we can see. The sound waves travel down the auditory canal and put pressure on the tympanic membrane -- also known as the eardrum -- causing vibration of the ossicles on the other end of the eardrum. This vibration continues through the ossicles and puts pressure on the oval window attached to the cochlea.<br /><br />The cochlea is where the sensation of hearing occurs. It is a fluid-filled space that spirals like a sea shell. Within the spirals of the cochlea are small hair cells called the organ of Corti. When pressure is put on the oval window, the fluid within the cochlea moves, and some hair cells are pressed down. When this happens, the hair cells become activated and transmit this information to the brain. Different perceptions of sound are based on the different combinations of sound waves pressing down various hair cells in the organ of Corti within the cochlea. People who are deaf or hard of hearing may have an ineffective cochlea or damage to that area. They may also have damage to the ossicles that transmit sound vibration.", "authors": "Hugh Darrow"}, "24729": {"title": "Blood on the Snow", "text": "The Roosville Incident\n\nThe Canadian parliament&#39;s enaction of the radical Paulsen Program in 2017 created what some observers described as the largest shift in military capacity seen on the North American continent since the last century.
