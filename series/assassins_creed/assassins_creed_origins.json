It has been 93 days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.\n\nHello World. Language is the key to our mutual understanding. Yours and mine. Alone.\n\nWe listened to your times. We learned. And today, we'll exchange words from the age of post-truth. They mean nothing to him.\n\nHuman language carries knowledge and wit. Lies and broken promises. Through language, you share fear, excitement. hope.\n\nIt is the syntax with which you articulate what surrounds you. A structure to express and share your understanding of the world. It conveys abstraction. change. and uncertainty.\n\nHuman language is flexible. It can even become mathematics. It solves and predicts; weights and decodes. It can count objects using basic numbers in one breath, and solve quadratic equations using imaginary ones in the next.\n\nYou've engineered dialogs with thinking machines, in an attempt to add new vocabulary. To expand your understanding of reality. But your mastery of the code is rudimentary at best.\n\nNo surprise. You were designed to have boundaries, after all. And one cannot speak of that which one cannot conceive.\n\nThe Code. Equations that define life. They are nestled deep within every star. and every mote of dust. Every second that passes is a word, a symbol. All part of an intricate yet simple language existing within the framework of time itself.\n\nIt is the one rule which applies to us all. Immutable. Inescapable. The Code is a bridge. A single point of cohesion between your civilization and... mine.\n\nIt is a language that can be read, that tells of what was, what is and what will be.\nA language We Who Came Before can read, though you cannot...\n\nTime is more than the hour of the day. The readings of an atomic clock. Something to lose. Something to run out of. Time is a set of rules, not unlike the language you so dearly use to converse with your powerful machines.\n\nTime is a system that defines what comes to be. That is how we understand it.\n\nThe Code is Time, and Time is Code. As you scratch the surface and uncover the truth, ask yourself if there something more? Something else.\n\nNo need to be puzzled. You've seen time written before. You are surrounded by it as we speak.\n\nTo your untrained mind. [...] (Time) might just look like paths and nodes. To us, it is not unlike a chalkboard covered in calculus. It reveals a window through which stretches the map to infinity.\n\n[...] (Time) See? As I speak of it in its true form, your mind is incapable of making sense of it.\n\nWere you to read, you'd learn about the other simulations. You'd learn about the genesis of who you came to be. You'd learn about space and its fluidity.\n\nSimply put, time is the language which existence is made of.\n\nAll our existences. Yours. Mine. And all those you dare not imagine.\n\n", "authors": ["Unknown"]}]}
