However, when I first came up with that thought, I was referring to the Greeks and Romans. But if we could be like Those Who Came Before, there would surely be no stopping us. I wonder what kind of art the First Civilization created. Did they have music? What did they consider to be beautiful?\n\nBut now, to the point of my correspondence.

The wars in Europe have spilled over into the New World, and English troops descended on Louisbourg.

Efficiency measured in human lives. John and I did what we could to prepare, while Abigail searched the city for the safe house.\n\nFinally, time ran out. John presented me with his Assassin robes. He said that the Templars would surely be on their way, if they were not already in the New World, and the time to establish a Brotherhood was now.
