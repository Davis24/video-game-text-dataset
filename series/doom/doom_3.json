Since Private Swensen wigged out, shot up that drink machine and lit himself up with a Plasma Gun, we've all been a bit nervous. All of us in maintenance knew he was losing it.  Finally when that darn drink machine wouldn't accept his credits, he lost it, started swearing up and down. You had to laugh when that machine lit up, but before any of us could react, he fed himself enough plasma to power an office building. There wasn't enough head to clean up, just vapor. It's a bad thing to happen to anyone.<br><br>Anyway, I know with all the psych problems we've had lately, we need the additional security, but when the guards start going nuts... I don't know. All this extra weapons and ammunition. I mean, do we really need so much firepower laying around? Well, a couple of us decided to lock up all the unsecured plasma rounds we could find. The code is 734. I think we'll all sleep a bit better tonight knowing it's locked up.<br><br>Note: According to the game files, the date is 10-30-2145. <br><br><br><h2>Email</h2><br><h3>More on Swensen</h3> <br><br>Date:  10-25-2145 <br><br>From: Mathew Morton<br><br>Steve, <br><br>I'm still shaken from that incident with Swensen. When I close my eyes I still see that look on his face in the instant between the impact of the plasma, and when his head turned to blue vapor. I don't think I'll ever be able to sleep again.<br><br>I never liked him, I don't know who was crazy enough to give him a plasma gun, but no one should go that way. The worst of it is I've seen a lot of folks who seem more on edge than Swensen was. Something needs to be done.<br><br>We should lock up the ammo in one of the storage lockers for starters. You pick the code. Make sure you file a report too.<br><br>-Mathew Morton<br><br><br><h3>Lets help this poor girl!</h3> <br><br>Date: 11-15-2145 <br><br>From: Eric Grossman<br><br>guys..... this isn't a chain letter, but a choice for all of us to save a little girl that's going to die of a serious and fatal form of cancer. Please send this to everyone you know...or don't know at that. This little girl has 6 months left to live her life, and as her last wish, she wanted to send a chain letter telling everyone to live their life to fullest, since she never will. She'll never make it to prom, graduate school, or get married and have a family of her own. By you sending this to as many people as possible, you can give her and her family a little hope, because with every name that this is sent to, the UAC will donate 3 credits per name to her treatment and recovery plan. One guy sent this to 500 people!!!! So, I know that we can send it to at least 5 or 6. Come on you guys.... and if you're too selfish to waste 10-15 minutes and scrolling this and forwarding it to EVERYONE, just think it could be you one day....and it's not even your credits, just your time. Please help this little girl out guys, I know you can do it!!

The demons came through the teleporters that they built, just like now. They created the Soul Cube and used it to stop the demons, to drive them back to Hell.

It is a fascinating artifact and as it turns out, it has some amazing properties. I wrote a new glyph pattern query yesterday and let it run all night. With the new query, the linguistics computer finally cracked the remaining glyphs!<br><br>The Soul Cube is by every definition a weapon, and it seems to have been built to repel whatever type of creatures invaded this ancient culture. If I am reading them right, during a battle the cube gains power with each life the wielder takes. When it is fully charged it can be used to slay even the strongest of creatures. Even more impressive is that when it kills a creature it transfers that creature's life force back to who is using the cube!<br><br>I know this sounds like magic and I have not been able to activate it to prove the theory but this is what the glyphs illustrate.<br><br>The glyphs specifically point out that you must kill five creatures before it becomes charged and then amazingly it will tell you it is ready.

I would like to file my third formal complaint to Central Authority about the problems with the work environment here in Exis.

They use our office space as an unauthorized shortcut and track dirt and debris as a result! In addition to their mess, they insist on drilling and hammering during our core staff hours. Some of them have repeatedly made inappropriate comments that clearly fall [sigh] under sexual harassment.

Actually, his exact words were: 'Don't worry your pretty little head about it.'<br><br>We are already on edge with the unexplained events occurring around the facility, and to add this insult to our tight schedule is too much to bear!

I've just left the weekly status meeting here at medical. The most prominent topic was the vast number of psychological issues we are seeing as of late. The number of reports indicates that 10% of the overall base personnel have shown symptoms. As many people will not come in for this type of thing, the number of affected personnel could truly be in the 30-40% range.<br><br>It is even manifested itself here in medical. We have several nurses and a couple of good doctors out for related reasons. I'm going to formally request two additional psychiatrists on the next shuttle from Earth.

According to the nurse, Mr. Wills was calm and exhibited no signs of disorder when he was brought to exam room 5. However, by the time I reached him at ten after four, his personality had changed dramatically.<br><br>When I entered the room, Mr. Wills lunged at me with a scalpel he apparently stole from a supply drawer. With assistance of an orderly we managed to subdue and sedate him without injury. Mr. Wills was heavily medicated and could not be diagnosed. But in the 20 minutes he was left unattended he managed to carve three symbols in his arm and cut his own tongue into two halves.<br><br>I can only guess at the cause of his problems. I hope that additional psychiatrists arrive soon. In the meantime in response to this assault, all medical supplies and armaments will be locked in a secure hospital cabinet with the code 347.

I've been examining the glyphs on the cube sharped artifact which some are calling the Soul Cube and combined with previous research data it is my conclusion the device is some sort of weapon.

Living in this god forsaken base is bad enough without having to watch the lights flicker constantly, it's just well, never mind, back to the task at hand.<br><br>What I've deciphered so far is a bit, I must say, disturbing. It seems that when one has possession of the artifact, if one inflicts damage or possibly kills another being, it extracts power from that event somehow and once a certain threshold has been reached, the artifact has the ability to kill anything you attack with it. How you attack with it I'm frankly not certain, indicating that the artifact is autonomous in some way.<br><br>To date I have only deciphered about um, two thirds, give or take of the markings but my initial glance at the rest of them indicates it harbors some far greater power. As you know, at this time we have not seen any reaction from the cube and it has withstood any scanning, abrasion or other test beyond picking it up and examining it.

Entry dated October 6, 2145. I've received the latest shipment of MK7 space suits from Earth today. They've a triple weave of titanium mesh on the outer layer for classified excursions. With the ongoing construction requiring additional EVA time on the Martian surface, these new suits should hold up better.  In the last two months we've had a number of unexplained suit decompressions resulting in fatalities. In the case of Technician Mike Stanley, the decompression was so rapid the resulting implosion caused him to almost liquify and fuse with the suit's interior. If it wasn't for his suit's name tag, eh, there wouldn't be much to identify him.<br><br>In each case, the penetrations and loss of pressure appear to occur from inside the suit rather than out. I can attest these suits were thoroughly inspected and micro-scanned after the incidents and no material degradations were found. Per UAC EVA regulations, the suits before the accidents were properly stored and locked away to prevent any mishandling.  I also followed up with the technicians on ensuring the suit's had the necessary pre-EVA checklist before anyone reaches the Martian atmosphere. I'm hoping the new suits will address the issue. Each suit lost this way just means more paperwork for me...<br><br>Along with the new suit shipment, we received additional medical supplies. I've placed the extra packs in the storage cabinet 071 with the access code of 532.

This will initiate the replacement procedure as well as create a repair report which notifies the repair team of an incoming module so minor repairs can be done on site with normal equipment.<br><br>I'm hoping the new system will need less and less use once the source of the recent power fluctuations is located and solved.

Why is it that I keep getting the crummy jobs?  Armor Corp, First Platoon and First Science Team were completely wiped out this morning on their second excursion... and I am the one in charge of writing up their reports and sending this information back to Earth next of kin.<br><br>[Sigh] So here I am... first cup of coffee for the day. Five hours of sleep the night before, no shower and I have 20 dead bodies to fill out paperwork on. I haven't seen their actual corpses but word coming down from the grapevine says it looks like they have been hacked up pretty good. This has everyone on the base spooked. Betruger is nowhere to be found and there are a lot questions being asked and no answers from anyone.<br><br>Last I heard they are suiting up the next outfit with the new BFGs.  Sounds like they aren't taking any chances on this next trip with them packing that kind of firepower. <br><br><br><h3>Missing BFG Guns</h3> <br><br>This is the audio log of administrative assistant Han Lee, dated October 20th, 2145.  Just when I thought this job couldn't get much worse, it did.  Delta Science sent another group of researchers through the portal two days ago and they failed to return at their scheduled time.  Radio transmissions to the research party have gone unanswered.  Even our LZ tracking systems can't find them. We fear that they are dead.<br><br>Losing lives is one thing but losing our proprietary technologies is another.  The team was equipped with the newest BFG weaponry.  We fear those guns may have fallen into the hands of those that killed them. We don't know who or what is behind that portal, but until we find out where our guns are I'm suggesting we suspend operations through the portal.

This Money originated from the accumulated royalties between 1976-1998 . Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political instability as a result of past Military rules (1985-1999) , he deposited this Money in a Strong Room/ Just before my father died he called my attention to the money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the transfer/investment of the funds abroad.

We are seeing an increasing level of random and unexplained violence by Exis staff.  The first incident occurred on October 13th, 2145 at the Exis surface tunnel.  One of the construction workers, Bill Sanders, was offloading a shipment of steel supports when a procurement manager stopped him.  In the heated conversation that followed, Sanders grabbed a nearby pickaxe and lunged at the manager.  Luckily the argument beforehand generated a sizable crowd, and when Sanders attacked the manager, a number of men were able to subdue him.<br><br>When we questioned Sanders afterwards he seemed to have developed short-term amnesia.  He-he didn't remember why he got so upset and attacked the manager.  He only recalled stopping his loader, and then moments later waking in the holding cell. [Sighs]  Since that event we have seen arguments progress more and more from heated shouting matches straight into outright brawls. The antagonists in these incidents all display the same conditions, as if they were suddenly possessed by violent anger, and then afterwards returned to normal.<br><br>We have only one serious life-threatening case so far, where engineer Leon Powell was stabbed multiple times.  I fear this is not the worst of our troubles, and have requested additional security personnel posted at critical junctions.  To assist in any immediate medical need, I have resupplied storage cabinet 965 with the accompanying code of 428.  Sergeant Nasir Adil out.  <br><br><br><h3>Upcoming VIP Visit</h3><br><br>Nasir Adil, personal log dated November 12th, 2145.  I have just received word from Central Authority that the UAC representative Counselor Elliot Swann will be arriving in a few days from Earth.  The-the report states that he will be reviewing all sectors of Mars City including Exis Labs. [Sighs]  I'm not sure that's a good idea in light of the recent events we've had here.  The violent assaults that seem to plague Exis Labs have caused the civilian staff to be pretty wary of one another.  And now to top it all off - missing weapons!  The cabinets in the security checkpoints were fully stocked two days ago, and now half the weapons are gone!  I-I don't know how this situation occurred, but my marines swear no one has access to the cabinet except for them.  I've ruled out those assigned to me and other security personnel.  But I can't figure out who else has those codes.<br><br>To sum up:  This is a bad situation.  Turning worse every day.  My recent request for more manpower in Exis Labs was denied.  It seems other sectors of Mars City are stretched thin, and the small reserves at the base are already allocated.  I needed to have faith in my current detachment of marines that they will turn things around.  I'll talk to Central again and see if Counselor Swann can bypass Exis.  The last thing I want is some staff worker with a sudden episode of dementia murdering a VIP.  I'm having enough problems trying to keep everyone here from killing each other.

The guys and I are seeing strange behavior around the Particle Exchanger, and it's really creeping us out.  Yesterday, Morgan almost lost it and I had to spend 20 minutes calming him down.  He swore he saw a huge bloody eyeball stare at him through the glass shielding.  We checked the area afterwards and found nothing.

We recently reached substantial completion on the facility's engineering sector and began work on the environmental systems sector early. At this rate, we should be able to impress the big boys over at Central Authority and score our completion bonuses. Heh. Last week I reviewed the construction documents and found another item that we can cut costs. My glass subcontractor mentioned the Moxim pressure seals for the exterior windows can be replaced with much cheaper Mixom seals. I submitted the alternative materials selection to the base architect for review. On our Tuesday progress meeting, he argued the Mixom seals aren't up to spec. [scoffs] He complained that those seals are inferior and could cause air leaks or glass blowouts - what the hell's he know? Pencil-neck brass thinks he's designing a fancy hotel. Hey, guess what? I was building shit before he was born!<br><br>Anyway, I managed to get the Mixom seals ordered. I bypassed the architect and talked directly to Corporate. I showed them the savings and that sealed the deal. We'll be installing the exterior windows in Environmental in a week and he will never know the difference. I'm so convinced the glass and seals will hold up, that I'm gonna take a rocket launcher and test it on those windows, need be. That'll show the stupid architect. Heh.

Anyhow, what we are doing is extremely complex and requires us to be firing on all cylinders. Expanding all the transference data from Delta has been a very difficult process. What he's proposing requires the full use of a single grid array. I'm just glad we have the entire auxiliary unit to work with.

Shortly after getting the auxiliary grid synched with the main array, we experienced a huge power surge... and, uh, the, uh, the output readings are nominal which, uh, leads me to conclude that it's not the auxiliary core. It-it sounds like a problem with the main array. Regardless, I... started hearing screams and gunfire over one of the channels just before our communications went down.<br><br>Well, we have been trying desperately to get in touch with Meyers over in Exis to see what he knows. Several of my technicians have not reported back yet, and my senior technician described... described a bloodbath near a coolant transfer zone.
