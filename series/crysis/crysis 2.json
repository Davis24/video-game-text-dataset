Prophet is to be captured alive and the nano-suit is to be damaged as little as possible in the process. I am merely conveying these instructions to your men where their comportment does not serve those ends.  Further to this, I submit that since the failure of evacuation and the lockdown, your troops have grown increasingly unprofessional and trigger-happy in their duties.

We have no wish to re-open new wounds for you, but must point out that this personal element forces us to consider the possibility of your having a \"vendetta mentality\" where the new technology is concerned. At present, although the US military has formally withdrawn from the N2 program, Pentagon funding for our research continues in force, and forms part of a substantial revenue stream for the company.

I stole Promethean nano-tech fire from them at<br> Tunguska and gifted it to the human race over the following century. I woke them at Lingshan.
