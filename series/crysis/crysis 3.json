The Stage Two Ceph are highly adaptive/reactive creatures.

As a consequence, the Ceph eliminated the many advantages of our numerical superiority, which were a key factor in our early victories over the aliens.<br><br><br><br><br> The purpose of the Second Stage Ceph is to conquer and terraform, eventually turning the planet into a Ceph hiveworld, which one day will be able to produce seed ships of its own.<br><br><br><br><br> <strong>The Alpha Ceph</strong><br><br><br><br><br> As part of the second stage, a unique Ceph creature rises to dominance. This creature has been named the 'Premor-Xenus' or 'Alpha Ceph' by CELL researchers and given the codename 'System X' for use in the wider world. The creature is remarkable in that it acts both the central nexus and focusing point for the Ceph hive mind, but also naturally generates near-unlimited amounts of energy through an internal reaction that researchers have been, so far, unable to replicate.

This impossibly huge Ceph hive has been given the name Over-Hive Hyperion, by CELL researchers. Two much smaller (though still immense) over-hives also exist in M33 - Over-Hive Iapetus to the west of the galactic core, and Over-Hive Coeus in the eastern fringes. Around a million additional hives covering three or more star systems are also known to exist in M33. Little is known about the ancient Ceph of the gigantic M33 over-hives, our researchers don't even have any clear idea of how they may look. But from what little we have been able to uncover, we are sure that they are almost unimaginably more advanced than the Ceph currently encountered on Earth. As my colleague, Dr. Glossop, recorded in his initial data assessment: \"We don't know what's out there in M33, but one thing's for sure - compared to them, the Ceph we have now are cavemen with stone clubs. And us? We barely rank as moss.\"<br><br><br><br><br><strong> The Seeding Ships</strong><br><br><br><br><br> Once a Ceph hive grows beyond a certain size, it starts to produce seeding ships.

The Ceph do not think like us. Their intelligence is vast, but they are so utterly different in terms of how that intelligence functions and how it manifests itself, that the Ceph genius can be difficult for a human being to even comprehend. Though it may seem counter-intuitive to us, the Ceph have become so very successful by being a reactive species. While human civilization is built upon knowledge being steadily passed on from generation to generation, each new Ceph hive begins with relatively little inherited knowledge from its parent hive, but instead has a deadly ability to adapt and react - and react fast. It is this ability that makes the Ceph able to succeed and thrive in a billion unimaginably different environments - from earth-like planets, to high gravity gas giants and ice spheres, or the unimaginably hot, the unimaginably toxic and the unimaginably strange regions of dark matter and warped space-time, where our rigid human thinking would at best be useless, and at worst send us mad in seconds.

Also, the linking of thousands of minds provides a level of mass processing power which - by even our most conservative estimates - makes our most advanced computing systems seem impossibly primitive. Though it remains difficult for us to comprehend structured alien thought, the overwhelming probability is that the Ceph hive mind is a super-genius. This raises a chilling possibility - though we barely understand the Ceph, they may understand us intimately.<br><br><br> The principle weakness of the Ceph Stage Two hive mind seems to be its complete dependence of the Alpha Ceph in order to function. One can only assume that the advantages outlined above more than compensate for this sizable flaw. Also, the inability of individual drones/hive members to act in any meaningful way without the consent or direction of the hive mind may be considered a secondary weakness from a human point of view. Individual identity, thought, passion, and will are utterly impossible prospects for a hive creature.
