The possessed blood mage Uldred took over the tower, and in his madness, he filled it with summoned demons and abominations. Cullen was imprisoned, tortured, and forced to watch the slaughter of his fellow templars. The ordeal shook him, and he emerged from it convinced that even templars fail to see how dangerous mages can be.\n\nAfter Cullen returned to his duties, it became clear that he would go to any lengths to enforce the Chantry&#39;s rule. His zeal troubled Knight-Commander Greagoir, who feared it unwise to let Cullen watch over the men and women he deemed responsible for his torment.\n\nGreagoir sent Cullen to serve under Knight-Commander Meredith in Kirkwall, and Meredith found Cullen&#39;s view of mages similar to her own. Of her company, only Cullen had seen mages&#39; potentially terrifying power firsthand, and she believed he could influence the other templars&#39; views. Consequently, Cullen rose quickly through the ranks to become Knight-Captain and Meredith&#39;s second-in-command.\n\nIf the Warden was a female mage in Dragon Age: Origins...\nFor some time, a rumor has circulated in the Gallows that Knight-Captain Cullen once fell in love with a young mage from the Circle of Ferelden. The mage was recruited into the Grey Wardens and went on to become the Hero of Ferelden. This rumor seems to cause Cullen pain, though no one knows if it is the pain of lost, unrequited love, or if Cullen is shamed by having had feelings for a mage, of all things.\n\nKnight-Commander Meredith maintains that the rumor is untrue and punishes anyone caught repeating it. \n", "authors": ["Unknown"]}, {"id": "20715", "title": "Merrill", "text": "\"The stories tell us that all elvhen once had the gift; but like so many things, it was lost.

She was the third child of the clan with the ancient gift born to her--when the next Arlathvenn (gathering of the clans) occurred, she was given to the Sabrae clan to be First to Keeper Marethari.

Aveline has so far deflected their inquiries on Fenris's behalf; however, she's told him in no uncertain terms that the situation will not remain that way forever.\r\n\r\nThough seemingly unconcerned about the house, Fenris has become increasingly nervous over the last year.

However, he&#39;s become increasingly restless and occasionally notes that it may almost be time for him to move on. Danarius has never reappeared, and Fenris assumes that he is now free to do as he wishes... but what will that be?

Bethany supports the Circle as it is, but this grows harder as Knight-Commander Meredith clamps down more tightly.\r\n\r\n<i>If Bethany was taken into the Deep Roads Expedition with Anders present:</i> \r\n\r\nSince joining the Grey Wardens, Bethany has had little contact with her family. Resentful that her sibling escaped the Deep Roads unscathed while she nearly died, Bethany communicates only with their mother, relaying little beyond the fact that she is alive and continues to travel with the Warden Stroud.

Sebastian cannot forget the irony that he still lives only because his family was so ashamed of his drinking and womanizing that they committed him to the Kirkwall Chantry against his will. After initially rejecting a priest&#39;s lifestyle, Sebastian was more surprised than anyone when he realized that his show of faith had turned real.\r\n\r\nSince then, his belief in the Maker and His plan for Thedas have been unshakable. Embracing his new role, Sebastian took vows of poverty and chastity to become a sworn brother of the Chantry... until word of his family&#39;s deaths forced him to take up worldly concerns once again. Grand Cleric Elthina, Sebastian&#39;s mentor and friend, hopes to convince him to walk away from the struggle for Starkhaven and return to the good works of the Chantry. \r\n\r\n<b>After the Deep Roads</b>\r\n\r\nSebastian has spent the past three years advancing his campaign to retake Starkhaven. He has been traveling extensively between Kirkwall and other Free Marches cities, attempting to recruit sufficient allies to build an army. With Hawke securing the Hawke family a place among Kirkwall's nobility, the two have crossed paths a few times, but an exiled prince like Sebastian has far better access than Hawke to the viscount and other heads of state. So far, though, few families have agreed to support Sebastian with actual troops, leaving him in the difficult position of trying to retake his city with no army. \r\n\r\n<b>The Last Three Years</b>\r\n\r\nAfter his confrontation with the desire demon Allure, Sebastian had a crisis of faith over breaking his priestly vows to pursue worldly power in Starkhaven. He questioned his own motives, worrying that he wanted to retake Starkhaven for his own personal power, not because it was the right thing to do. Trusting Starkhaven's fate to the Maker, he returned to the Chantry, but was turned away by Grand Cleric Elthina, who believed he had not yet committed fully to either course.\r\n\r\nThough he has not renewed his vows or returned to his duties as a brother, Sebastian proved a faithful servant to the grand cleric over the past three years. As Kirkwall grows ever-more turbulent, the grand cleric relies on Sebastian to be her eyes and ears in the often-dangerous secular world. Whether he will again devote himself to the Chantry or return to Starkhaven is still anyone's guess, though Sebastian was heard saying that he will not leave Kirkwall as long as both the Champion and the grand cleric need him.

Demons are drawn to mages, though whether it is because of this awareness or simply by virtue of their magical power in our world is unknown.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reason, a demon always attempts to possess a mage when it encounters one&mdash;by force or by making some kind of deal depending on the strength of the mage. Should the demon get the upper hand, the result is an unholy union known as an abomination. Abominations have been responsible for some of the worst cataclysms in history, and the notion that some mage in a remote tower could turn into such a creature unbeknownst to any was the driving force behind the creation of the Circle of Magi.\r\n\r\nThankfully, abominations are rare. The Circle has methods for weeding out those who are too at risk for demonic possession, and scant few mages would give up their free will to submit to such a bond with a demon. But once an abomination is created, it will do its best to create more. Considering that entire squads of templars have been known to fall at the hands of a single abomination, it is not surprising that the Chantry takes the business of the Circle of Magi very seriously indeed.", "authors": ["Unknown"]}, {"id": "20769", "title": "Ghast", "text": "Occasionally, a pack of ghasts will include the strange creature known as the velghastrial.

It took a form that I would call female, though I had no doubt that it could appear otherwise. I wondered if it appeared as it did because I wanted it to or because I expected it to. She... and, indeed, I could only think of her as such now... smiled warmly at me and laughed a musical sound that seemed to thrill my old heart.\nSo frightened was I of this creature&#39;s legendary abilities to twist the hearts of men, and so relieved was I when I looked across the table into her dark eyes.

In folklore, such demons are characterized as peddlers of lust, luring their prey into a sexual encounter only to be slain at the culmination. While a desire demon can indeed deal in pleasure, in truth they deal with any manner of desire that humans can possess: wealth, power, and beauty, to name a few.\n\nFar more intelligent than the bestial hunger and rage demons, and more ambitious than the demons of sloth, these dark spirits are among the most skilled at tempting mages into possession. Many who serve the whims of a desire demon never realize it. They are manipulated by illusions and deceit if not outright mind control, although these demons are reluctant to resort to such crude measures. Instead, they seem to take great pleasure in corruption. The greater the deceit, the greater their victory.\n\nOnly demons of pride prove more fearsome opponents when roused. Their abilities to affect the mind allow them to assume disguises and even alter the environment to their purposes, not to mention the great strength and speed they possess if they should have to resort to more physical means. Most often a desire demon will attempt to bargain its way to freedom if overpowered&mdash;many stories exist that depict mages defeating desire demons to the point where a wish can be wrested from them.

The author of this text is unnamed, and prefers it that way. But I know him. I have studied with him. And I can speak to his obsession with detail and objectivity, the latter being something with which I sometimes struggle.\n\nYou could say that his approach with regards to accuracy is &ldquo;ruthless.&rdquo;\n\nBut, as I said in Val Royeaux, ours is a large, complicated world. It is perhaps inevitable that a few errors survive numerous readings and are then committed to print.\n\nWith this in mind, here are a few points in The World of Thedas that, based on my studies and travels, warrant correction:\n\nPage 12: The main text states that the First Blight lasted one hundred years. Most authorities agree that it was fought for 192 years. The timeline in the tome is correct.\n\nPage 12: The timeline states that the Old Gods whispered to Humanity from the Black City in -2800 Ancient. At this time, the legendary city would still be known as &ldquo;The Golden City,&rdquo; as it was not yet sullied by the presence of men.\n\nPage 42: The term &ldquo;ralshokra,&rdquo; said to be a Qunari military challenge where the higher ranks are fought for and defended to the death, is not a Qunari term at all. Its use can be traced back to the Storm Age, first appearing in a popular Orlesian children&rsquo;s story meant to demonize the invading race. There&rsquo;s no evidence that any Qunari actually participate in something so barbaric.\n\nPage 126: The timeline also states that in 8:45 Blessed, the nobility continued a &ldquo;guerrilla war against the occupying Orlesians, led by Brandel&rsquo;s daughter Moira.&rdquo; While the Rebel Queen Moira did eventually lead the war, she was born after 8:45 Blessed.\n\nPage 136: The timeline puts Celene&rsquo;s birth at 9:6 and her ascension at 9:20, making her, according to the timeline, fourteen when she became empress. However, the main text says she was sixteen when she took the throne. By all accounts, the main text is correct. Celene was born in 9:4 Dragon.\n\nPage 141: There are rumors in some circles of an intelligent darkspawn known as the Architect, who attempted to unearth and kill the remaining Old Gods and taint the entire surface world. Though the timeline says 9:14 Dragon, most reliable sources state these events actually occurred in 9:10 Dragon.\n\nPage 146: The timeline states that Bhelen Aeducan was the middle child of King Endrin Aeducan. He was actually King Endrin&rsquo;s youngest child.\n\nPage 157: The main text says that the darkspawn sacked Minrathous in 1:31 Divine. While it is true that Minrathous nearly fell during the Second Blight, the infamous heart of the Imperium has never actually been taken. This is stated elsewhere in the book.\n\nPage 176: In the glossary, the definition of Archon as Tevinter&rsquo;s &ldquo;monarch&rdquo; is technically incorrect. It would be more accurate to call the Archon a &ldquo;ruler.&rdquo;\n\nPage 177: The &ldquo;First Warden&rdquo; is the leader of the Grey Wardens at Weisshaupt. The glossary incorrectly states that he is the &ldquo;Commander of the Grey.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure what my peer was drinking when he wrote this one.\n\nWith these corrections, perhaps the record has now been set straight.

There the magister&#39;s serfs worked the quarries for the jet stone needed for the mighty temples of Minrathous. After a slave rebellion nearly burned the temple to the ground in the great city, it was determined that a center for the slave trade would need to be established well away from the more civilized parts of the Imperium. (Though this account may be exaggerated, since the notorious Archon Vanarius Issar narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of an elven slave at the time.)\n\nBecause the new slave outpost would become wealthy beyond imagining, competition among prospects reportedly took over twenty years to resolve, resulting in great bloodshed in the frontier, well away from the archon&#39;s eyes. Magister took arms against magister, mostly in the form of small armies of serfs and mercenaries. Over half the slaves in existence allegedly died in these battles before Emerius was finally chosen, thanks to the marriage of Krayvan&#39;s son to the archon&#39;s daughter.\n\nWithin a mere decade, the mighty fortress was erected on the cliff where Kirkwall now stands. Over one million slaves passed through its gates before the Imperium eventually fell, an unimaginable number by today&#39;s standards. The Krayvan family itself became patrons of the next three archons and was one of the driving forces behind the extension of the Imperial Highway into the Fereldan Valley, a move that would cost them considerable political influence after the resistance of the Alamarri tribes.

These, she informed me, were my attackers in the countryside, the same band that wreaked such havoc on Vindaar.\r\n\r\nThe Tal-Vashoth wage a bitter war against the Qun, the Qunari, and sometimes against order itself.

One assumes it&#39;s the Divine, but how much could She know about their activities when their very existence is a mystery to most?\r\n\r\n&mdash;A letter from an unknown priest, found in the Grand Cathedral archives, 8:80 Blessed\r\n\r\n<b>Dragon Age Inquisition</b>\r\n\r\nThe Seekers of Truth aren&#39;t templars... not precisely. Once they were called the Inquisition, but upon the signing of the Nevarran Accord, they gave up that name and became the Order they are now, standing over us templars as watchers and enforcers. I honestly cannot claim to know more than that. I don&#39;t know how many Seekers there are&mdash;a few dozen? If they have a base of operations, I don&#39;t know where it is. Certainly not with any of us. The only time we&#39;ll see one is when a Seeker is summoned, perhaps in response to a complaint by one of the first enchanters. They&#39;ll investigate the problem, and if it turns out a templar did something they don&#39;t like, he&#39;s disciplined. Severely. Without question. Even the knight-commander bows to their will. If a Seeker of Truth shows up, you know every last templar is sweating, hoping their gaze doesn&#39;t fall on him.\r\n\r\nOf course, that changed when the Nevarran Accord was broken. I&#39;m told the Chantry broke it, but it was Lord Seeker Lambert who made the announcement. He said the Seekers of Truth and the Templar Order were going to hunt rebel mages, no matter what the Divine commanded. I didn&#39;t know he had that authority, that he could just say we would do this and everyone would follow... but we did. I never thought of it that way, but the Seekers have always been our guides.

Even though surface dwarves are officially stripped of their caste, many maintain a hierarchy among themselves along the old caste lines. Formerly noble houses are accorded more respect than casteless brands who come up in search of opportunity. The poorest &quot;noble&quot; dwarf on the surface looks upon the rich &quot;lower caste&quot; dwarves with contempt.\n\nUpper-class surface dwarf society is roughly divided into two camps: kalnas, who insist on maintaining caste and rank (typically those from the Noble or Merchant Caste families) and ascendants, who believe in leaving Orzammar&#39;s traditions underground and embracing life in the sunlit world.\n\nMaintaining some tie to Orzammar was seen for generations as the only lifeline for surface dwarves. Bringing surface goods to their kin underground and lyrium and metals to the surface was not only the most lucrative means of making a living, but also a sort of sacred duty, as many surface dwarves willingly accepted exile and the loss of their caste to better serve their house or patron. In recent years, many surface dwarves, particularly ascendants, have branched out. They started banks, mercenary companies, and overland trade caravans. They became investors and speculators in purely surface trade. These new industries have proven tremendous sources of wealth, but are looked down upon by their more conservative kin.\n\nFor less-affluent surface dwarves, association with a powerful kalna can open many doors. They can get credit with dwarven merchants and are offered work opportunities by the powerful Dwarven Merchants&#39; Guild more readily, sometimes, than more qualified but less-connected individuals.\n\n&mdash;From The Dowager&#39;s Field Guide to Good Society, by Lady Alcyone", "authors": ["Lady Alcyone"]}, {"id": "20961", "title": "The Qunari - Asit tal-eb", "text": "When the Ashkaari looked upon the destruction wrought by locusts,\n\nHe saw at last the order in the world.\n\nA plague must cause suffering for as long as it endures,\n\nEarthquakes must shatter the land.\n\nThey are bound by their being.\n\nAsit tal-eb.

Perhaps this was a hasty estimate, but it was true for Kirkwall. Viscount Chivalry Threnhold was a vicious thug who took power through a campaign of intimidation, and his son Perrin who succeeded him in 9:14 Dragon Age was even worse.\n\nTaxes were crippling and Perrin Threnhold used the ancient chains extending from &quot;the Twins&quot; standing at Kirkwall&#39;s harbor&mdash;unused since the New Exalted Marches&mdash;to block sea traffic and charge exorbitant fees from Orlesian ships. The Empire threatened invasion following the closure of the Waking Sea passage, and for the first time, the Chantry used the templars to pressure the viscount. Until that point, the templars had done nothing to counter the Threnholds even though, as the largest armed force in Kirkwall, they could have.

We are here to safeguard the city against magic, not against itself.&quot; The divine, as a friend to the emperor, clearly had other ideas.\n\nIn response, Viscount Perrin hired a mercenary army, forcing a showdown with the templars.

They were often targeted by Orlesian and Free Marcher cities that were bent on destroying the pirates once and for all. After each such effort, new pirates would appear to fill the vacuum.\n\nDuring the New Exalted Marches, the nations of Thedas needed every ship they could muster against the massive power of the Qunari dreadnoughts. The Llomerryn pirates were faced with a difficult decision: they had to band together under one flag and fight with those they had previously preyed upon or face conversion and annihilation by the Qunari.\n\nThus the Armada was formed. The pirates brought their knowledge of stealth and trickery to bear, plaguing Qunari supply lines and even launching seaborne invasions against the Qunari coast. For a time it was said the Armada was the premier naval power of Thedas, and after the signing of the Llomerryn Accord, they maintained their association rather than disband as many had hoped.\n\nWealthy merchants now often pay the leaders of the Armada rather than risking their ships commandeered and their merchandise stolen and sold on the black market.

They had no urge to create, and even when instructed to do so possessed no imagination to give their creations ingenuity or life.\n\nThe Maker realized His own folly: He had created the spirits to resemble Him in all but the one and most important way: they did not have a spark of the divine within them.

The spirits wished to know more of life, hoping to find a way to regain the Maker&#39;s favor. Through the eyes of the living, they experienced new concepts: love, fear, pain, and hope. The spirits re-shaped the Fade to resemble the lives and concepts they saw, each spirit desperately trying to bring the most dreamers to their own realm so they could vicariously posses a spark of the divine through them.\n\nAs the spirits grew in power, however, some of them became contemptuous of the living. These were the spirits that saw the darkest parts of the dreamers.

The wars with the Alamarri wouldn&#39;t start until centuries later.\r\n\r\nEach clue we find only leads to more questions, but we will not give up.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Underneath a pile of small boulders carved with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nIn the back alleys of Lowtown you can find extraordinary things. Priceless tomes of knowledge can be bought with a handful of gold: The Chant of Archon Lovais, a whole chapter of the Midnight Compendium. Some of these books were thought lost forever!\r\n\r\nAnd these are no forgeries. I&#39;ve verified their authenticity myself. The fences have no inkling that what they&#39;re selling has value. Where did these books come from?\r\n\r\nAfter several failed attempts, I got my answer underneath the city. There is a hive of hidden passages in Kirkwall&#39;s sewers. Now and then a lucky &quot;sewer rat&quot; comes across an unlooted chamber, and then a cache of ancient Tevinter relics spreads through the black market. We must search below the city.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Underneath a cobblestone with curious markings, faintly glowing. It is signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA maze of caves, sewers, and hidden passages! We found three Tevinter chambers already looted, but today (tonight?) we found one closed. It was a small cell containing a few trinkets and a common tome, but it symbolizes hope. The magisters had hundreds of mages deep below Kirkwall. They lived and researched here, far from the scrutiny of common men.\r\n\r\nMany ancient cities specialized in arcane research, but why did Kirkwall hide its efforts here? Why go to such great pains to keep it out of sight? Were they a cabal of renegade magisters? Or was this a special project of the archon?\r\n\r\n&mdash;Hidden in a small fissure near curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA master mason made a comment that set my mind afire. She said that of all the cities she&#39;s worked in, Kirkwall was the most difficult, and that the city is almost literally a maze. Recollecting my first years in Kirkwall, I have to agree. Getting lost was commonplace. The city was a sprawling mess.\r\n\r\nThe mason showed me a plan of the city, and my heart skipped a beat. There were patterns in the intersections, back alleys, and boulevards. Some magisters believed in the power of symbols or shapes. In the oldest parts of the city, one can make out the outlines of glyphs in the very streets! What manner of magic is this?\r\n\r\n&mdash;Underneath a cobblestone with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nIronically, the Chantry has the best records on the Imperium occupation that we&#39;ve found&mdash;none of the forbidden texts, which have undoubtedly been destroyed, but many administrative records. In their cold, numbered rows, misery is told. Thousands of slaves passed through the Gallows to work the mines or to be shipped elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe list of elven children is numbing: &quot;three maimed, two mute, and four serviceable.&quot; These numbers don&#39;t add up. For every thousand slaves that came to Kirkwall, a hundred disappeared. I checked the tax rolls, as well, and the discrepancy exists there, too, if one has the wit to see it: 203 slaves went missing in the Imperium&#39;s 312th year! That&#39;s just one year. Other records showed similar discrepancies. Over centuries, practically a whole civilization of slaves simply disappeared.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Hidden inside the cover of a book with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nAfter pursuing another dead end, we were attacked by maleficarum. I fear V. will not make it. The fences must have tipped them off. Are they cultists trying to protect the answer? Are they after it themselves? Or was it a random attack?\r\n\r\nThe mages of Kirkwall have a more troubled history than those in other Circles. A greater percentage of them do not survive the Harrowing, and a greater percentage turn to blood magic&mdash;almost double that of Starkhaven or Ostwick. Is there a secret fraternity delving into the Tevinter secrets of this city?\r\n\r\nEither way, we must be more careful, lest we become the Band of One. Or None.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Hidden under a cobblestone with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nAccess has not been easy, and I fear my disguise will not bear great scrutiny. But I saw the records the templars say do not exist. The blood of countless slaves was spilled beneath the city in sacrifice. Whole buildings were built upon lakes of blood. The sewers have grooves where blood would flow, all leading down. The scale is hard to fathom.\r\n\r\nA blood mage can channel great power from a simple cut. At least a thousand unfortunates died here every year for centuries. For what ungodly purpose would one need so much power?\r\n\r\nI must retreat now before I am uncovered. But the answer is close.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Behind a panel with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Veil is thin in Kirkwall, small wonder given the suffering in the city. But we&#39;ve discovered the magisters were deliberately thinning it even further. Beneath the city, demons can contact even normal men. Did they seek the Black City to compound the madness of their previous efforts? Or was it something else? We&#39;ve found a chamber where the Veil is at its thinnest, long-since looted, but the power is still there. Tonight we will go there. Pray for us. Pray for us all.\r\n\r\n&mdash;Hidden behind a rock with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nA recent trove was uncovered. This one was big, perhaps the archon&#39;s visitation chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd a flood of tomes is on the market. Even the simple fences know something is amiss&mdash;they&#39;ve raised their prices at the frenzy of collectors. One said he sold a copy of the Fell Grimoire! I doubt he would lie; how could he know that tome is a mere legend?\r\n\r\nIf that is real, then what of the Forgotten Ones? This journey has taken us to many strange places, and made us re-evaluate many former truths. Where will it end?\r\n\r\n&mdash;Hidden under a cobblestone with curious markings and signed, &quot;The Band of Three&quot;\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nWe went to the center of it all. F. is dead and I am alone and injured. I must go back and put an end to it. The maddening thing is there is still no answer. But the Forgotten One, or demon or whatever it is, must be destroyed. I fear one may already be unbound.\r\n\r\nI foreswear my oaths. The magister&#39;s lore must be burned and the ashes scattered. No good can come of it.
