Intended for breaking formations with a thunderous mounted charge, they were meticulously trained in horsemanship and hand-to-hand combat with lance and sabre. In the Russian advance in the summer of 1914, the Hussars were often sent on reconnaissance missions far ahead of the infantry. They also guarded their infantry&#39;s flanks, screened their maneuvers, and intercepted enemy patrols. Outfitted with carbines and revolvers, they were even able to dismount and fight on foot, but were no match against well-positioned or entrenched infantry. Instead, they fought smaller skirmishes or exploited gaps in the frontline with their speed. The nature of the war eventually forced the Hussars off their horses and into the trenches, but the regiments maintained their cohesion until the Revolutions of 1917 broke the tradition of the loyal Hussar Regiments.

Over 250,000 of the Chauchat were made, making it the most produced automatic weapon of WW1. Its popular name comes from the lead designer of the weapon, Colonel Louis Chauchat. The Chauchat has often been called \"The Worst Gun Ever\", which is an undeserved reputation.<br><br>The origins of the Chauchat go back to 1903, when Louis Chauchat and Charles Sutter at the Puteaux Arsenal began work on a weapon intended to be very light, operable by one man and firing the standard 8mm Lebel cartridge. Over the following years they developed several prototypes of their C.S Machine Rifle. It was quite similar to the later Chauchat, but with the curved magazine on top of the receiver. After successful trials of the C.S Machine Rifle in January 1913 the French army ordered 100 copies, which barely got delivered before war broke out. Since the C.S was one of the lightest automatic weapons around they were mounted on French aircraft early in WW1. None of these weapons remain today.<br><br>Soon General Jaffre demanded a very light automatic support weapon for the infantry. It was decided to base this new weapon on the C.S Machine Rifle, since the design already existed and it had been tested, and it fired the standard Lebel rounds, which would simplify logistics. It was also projected that the C.S could be inexpensively mass produced in converted civilian plants, and the bulk of Chauchats were built by the former bicycle factory Gladiator. Chauchat and Sutter quickly updated their previous design, which was adopted by the French army in 1915 and issued to the front line from 1916.<br><br>In many ways the Chauchat was a precursor to the modern assault rifle, weighing only 9kg and featuring semi- or full automatic fire, a pistol grip, in-line stock and a 20 round detachable magazine. The main difference to a modern assault rifle is the Chauchat's use of a full power cartridge, rather than an intermediate one. The Chauchat is the only fully automatic weapon to use the \"long recoil\" operating mechanism, inspired by the Model 8 Autoloading rifle.<br><br>When the Americans arrived on the front in 1918 they were supplied with the Chauchat, called \"Sho-Sho\" by the US troops. It is believed their experience with the weapon is a big part of its poor reputation today. Almost 20,000 Chauchats had been produced in US .30-06 caliber for issuing to the Americans, but the .30-06 was more powerful than the original Lebel round, and the production had been plagued by many defects. Because of this the .30-06 version of the Chauchat performed horribly and was only used for training, but the bad impression stuck with the American soldiers.<br><br>During the war it was found that 75% of stoppages of the Chauchat were due to problems with the magazines. They were made of thin metal and easily got deformed, but the main problems were the large witness holes on the sides, which easily let it dirt and dust. The Chauchat was certainly not a perfect weapon, but was highly effective in its day, providing essential fire support for the French troops during attacks. French medal records show that Chauchat gunners were instrumental to the success of modern assault tactics, including its use in neutralising machine gun nests.

In 1891 the Imperial Russian Army adopted the equally famous Mosin-Nagant service rifle, incorporating design features of the Belgian weapon designer L&#130;on Nagant, which had made L&#130;on and his brother &#144;mile well-known in Russian Tsarist and military circles. After the adoption of the Mosin-Nagant rifle, the Tsar requested a modern sidearm for officers and troops, and in 1895 the Russian army adopted the Nagant brothers&#39; revolver. In a twist of fate, seven of the Nagant revolvers would be used to murder the Tsar and his family in 1918. Designed between the late 1880&#39;s and early 1890&#39;s, the Nagant revolver is virtually unique in that it utilizes a gas-tight seal. Most revolvers have a small gap between the cylinder and the barrel, allowing the cylinder to rotate, leading to some of the propellant gases escaping through the gap and lowering the muzzle velocity. The cylinder of the M1895 instead slides forward a little upon cocking, sealing the cylinder against the barrel forcing cone. The gun also uses a proprietary 7.62x38mmR cartridge, with the bullet enclosed inside the casing, and a crimp just above the bullet which expands into the forcing cone upon firing. These two features of the M1895 extracts the maximum energy from the propellant gases, increasing the muzzle velocity to 891 ft/s (272 m/s). The gas-tight seal also allowed a sound suppressor to be mounted, which is unusual for revolvers. The biggest downside of this design is that each cartridge has to be loaded and extracted one by one through a loading gate - making the M1895 slower to reload than many contemporary break-action revolvers, which could use speed-loaders and eject all spent cases at once. Still, the Nagant Revolver served extensively with the Russians through and beyond WW1 and was highly appreciated for its extreme sturdiness and dependability. Even as more modern pistols like the T33 appered alongside it, the M1895 kept serving, with over 2 million built when production finally ceased ca 1950. Many other nations also used the Nagant revolver, like Belgium, Kazakhstan, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ukraine. After WW2 it kept on being used in the Chinese Civil War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War - with some security forces still being equipped with the Nagant M1895 well into the 21st century.\n", "authors": ["Unknown [Battlefield 1]"]}, {"id": 24504, "title": "MG15 n.A ", "text": "During the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the German army came up against the Lewis Gun in great numbers and realized that they lacked a similar weapon, as they only had some Madsens and the MG 08/15 had not yet been fielded.

It was heavily based on some pre-existing rifle parts, including Lebel stocks and Berthier barrels. The Lebel had been discontinued years earlier ,and utilizing some of its parts and machinery was a way of keeping manufacturing costs down, and the trio's design was also the only one to fire the 8mm Lebel round that was standard in the Army. The first prototypes were adopted from Lebel M1886/93 rifles and immediately showed promise, leading to continued development. The Lebel rifle had a tubular magazine under the barrel, and this space was cleverly used for the gas mechanism, which tapped gas at the front of the fore end and actuated an operating rod.

The RSC 1917 was generally reliable and appreciated by soldiers, but with the same length as the Lebel and the added weight of the gas mechanism it weighed 5.25kg unloaded, compared to 4.41Kg for a fully loaded Lebel rifle.

Military trials began in 1911, and in 1912 the Rifle Commission of the Russian Army ordered 150 more of Fedorov&#39;s rifle for further testing. In 1913, Fedorov rechambered the self-loading rifle for his experimental 6.5 mm cartridge, which produced less recoil and was more suitable for automatic fire. This model was tested in late 1913, but further trials and development was halted by the outbreak of WW1. Captain Fedorov was sent to the Western Front in 1915 to observe the deployment of small arms, and there he was impressed by the Chauchat machine rifle, which inspired him to convert his self-loading rifle to use 25-round detachable magazines and fully automatic fire. The same year the Russian Army was in desperate need of lightweight automatic weapons, and it ordered the manufacture of Fedorov&#39;s new machine rifle - but to save time and resources it was decided to convert the weapon to use the similar Japanese 6.5x50mmSR Arisaka cartridge, which Russia was already using. The Russian Army adopted the Fedorov Avtomat in 1916, and it was first used in combat on the Romanian front, for example by a special unit of the 189th Izmail infantry regiment which were armed with 45 of the 6.5mm Fedorov Avtomats, and 8 of the earlier 7.62mm self-loading rifles.

The pistol protruded behind the grip in a somewhat awkward and bulbous shape which housed the main spring of the gun, and this was arguably the primary weakness of the design. The C-93 was, however, sold standard together with an attachable wooden stock which turned it into a practical, small semi-automatic carbine. The C-93 was tested by the US Navy in 1894, and a newspaper article stated that; &quot;a light adjustable stock may be affixed, making for all practicable purposes a carbine for the cavalry&quot;. But the various militaries that tested the weapon around the turn of the century were mostly looking for an effective handgun. Borchardt also developed a new 7.65x25mm cartridge for the C-93, which would be the inspiration for the 7.63x25mm Mauser, 7.65x21mm Luger Parabellum, and 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridges.

Clever commanding officers knew how to use rum as an effective motivational tool, often giving men who were setting off on particularly dangerous tasks a double-ration to keep their courage going. Once Russia started mobilizing for the war, Tsar Nicholas II prohibited the sale and use of Vodka. A strong influence on this decision was the embarrassing behavior and lack of discipline shown by drunken Russian soldiers during the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905.

A daily allowance of Pinard wine for the French soldier consisted of a 250 ml or 8.5 fluid ounces a day but this would grow larger with time as battles on the front intensified.

Initially the Commission attempted to convert the Lange Pistole 08 to full-auto fire, but the light weight and excessive fire rate made it uncontrollable. Hugo Schmeisser - the son of Louis Schmeisser, who in the 1890s had designed blowback operated pistols - began developing his father's design into a larger weapon system for fully automatic fire in 1916. Prototypes of Schmeisser's Machine Pistol were submitted for testing and evaluation, where its revolutionary open bolt blowback mechanism proved to be extremely durable. It was a sturdy weapon featuring a conventional rifle stock, and fittings and finish of near commercial grade. The receiver was made of thick tube, and the bolt was machined from a single block of steel - the entire gun consisting of only 34 parts. The initial prototypes used 20 round box magazines, but the Testing Commission insisted on adoption of the 32 round Trommelmagazin, as it was already widely used for the P08.<br><br>In early 1918, Schmeisser's weapon was finally adopted as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maschinenpistole 18, I\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and 50,000 were immediately ordered for the upcoming Kaiserschlacht offensive, where the MP 18 became the preferred weapon of the Sturmtruppen and proved itself ideal for fire and movement tactics.

In combat the Trommelmagazin would turn out to be one of the main weaknesses of the MP 18, as it was complicated and had difficulty coping with the rate of fire, but overall the weapon performed well. Heinrich Vollmer designed an experimental magazine for the MP 18 with a 60 round spool magazine carried on the soldiers hip, connected to the weapon by a flexible hose.<br><br>The MP 18 could not be produced in the intended numbers, with at least 30,000 of the weapons believed to have been made by the time of the Armistice, but only about 10,000 of those reaching the frontline. During the Battle of the Selle on 17 October 1918, the 1st Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry captured an MP 18 from the German defenders - the booty getting marked on the stock and residing in a British museum today. The French too captured many MP 18's during their final offensives and began to study them, leading directly to the development of several inter war Sub-machine Guns like the MAS 1924. Confiscated stocks of MP 18's were issued to French soldiers after WW1, and France even developed their own extended magazines for them.<br><br>The impact of the MP 18 on the Allies was evident by the Versailles treaty specifically limiting the number of SMGs that Germany was allowed to build and possess, including a few hundred MP 18's for the German police. These were converted back to using the original 20 round magazines, which were then patented by Schmeisser and marked with his name. These magazines would later be used in German SMG's like the MP 40, which is widely believed to be the reason why Hugo Schmeisser is often incorrectly believed to be the designer of the MP 40, while ironically being largely forgotten for actually creating the revolutionary MP 18. The weapon kept on being used by the paramilitary Freikorps, and in 1922 an MP 18 was used to assassinate the Foreign Minister of the Weimar Republic, Walther Rathenau. Germany would not issue another SMG until the MP 38, but the MP 18 stayed in limited use with the German army through WW2.

The trio began work on what was to become the Chauchat light machine gun in the years before the war, and later they designed the RSC 1917 semi-automatic rifle. Several other fully automatic weapons would emerge from the Gladiator factory, but probably the most important yet obscure of these was the Ribeyrolles Machine Carbine 1918 - considered by many today to be the first true assault rifle.<br><br>Before and during WW1 France purchased large numbers of the American M1907 Self Loading rifle, firing a proprietary .351 intermediate cartridge, with power between a full rifle round and a pistol round. Many of the M1907s were used highly effectively in trench warfare as \"proto assault rifles\", and this weapon and its ammunition would inspire French weapon designers.<br><br>Paul Ribbeyrolles was the General Manager of the Gladiator factory, and from 1916 he led the design of their Machine Carbine and its experimental intermediary cartridge, the 8x35 Ribeyrolles. The cartridge was a necked down .351 M1907 casing, combined with an 8mm Lebel bullet - resulting in the first truly intermediate round. The weapon itself was a compact, blowback operated carbine with a detachable 25-round magazine, a fire select switch for semi- and fully-automatic fire - but also a folding bipod and lugs for the Berthier bayonet. The Ribeyrolles 1918 therefore met all the modern criteria that have been established for an \"Assault Rifle\", about 30 years before the STG44 and AK-47. The Russian Federov Avtomat was designed a few years earlier than the Ribeyrolles 1918 and used the intermediate 6.5x50mmSR Arisaka cartridge, making it a contender for the title.<br><br>The first military trials for the Ribeyrolles 1918 Machine Carbine were held in July 1918, but unlike the RSC 1917 it was not immediately adopted - an important difference being that the RSC 1917 used regular 8mm Lebel rounds which significantly simplified ammunition logistics. The Ribeyrolles 1918 continued to be tested for the rest of the war, and some sources claim it was approved for frontline testing. The 8x35 Ribeyrolles round was found to have a maximum effective range of 400 meters, which was considered unsatisfactory at the time. At 5.1kg unloaded, there were also complains about the weight of the weapon, which was peculiar considering the fact that the Chauchat was nearly twice as heavy, and the MP18 only about a kilo lighter.<br><br>Today an effective range of 400 meters is considered well within the requirement for an Assault Rifle, but these findings at the time, together with the fact that the Ribeyrolles 1918 was equipped with a bipod, reveals that the weapon was still primarily intended and expected to be a squad support weapon like the light machine guns of the era. This is hardly surprising, as the concept of the Assault Rifle was not named and defined until the end of WW2. The Ribeyrolles was ultimately rejected by the French army in 1921.

The turret housed three men and was placed so high that they had to reach it by a ladder and sat in seats suspended from the turret roof. At the rear of the tank was a smaller machine gun turret, and both turrets had stroboscopic cupolas. The 2C's armor was among the thickest of WW1-era tanks, with 22mm on the sides and 45mm in the front.

The Auto Revolver instead uses the recoil energy to let the barrel and cylinder slide back while a cam pin runs into the grooves on the cylinder, making it rotate and re-cock the hammer. The design provided the intended benefits of a high rate of fire and some absorbed recoil, but the mechanism was more sensitive to dirt than traditional revolvers.<br><br>Fosbery's Auto Revolver went into production in 1902 and was available in .455 and .38 calibres, but the vast majority of the almost 5000 guns that would be produced up until 1924 were in .455 calibre, then with a 6-round cylinder. The Auto Revolver was submitted to military trials but never officially adopted. It was a relatively big and heavy handgun, which was probably part of the reason. Nevertheless, the Auto Revolver did become popular with some target shooters, and in a time when Army officers picked their own sidearms, quite a few British officers would pick the Auto Revolver.<br><br>It saw some action in the Second Boer War, and in WW1 it was also used by pilots before machine guns were commonplace on aircraft.
