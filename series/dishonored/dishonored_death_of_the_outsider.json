These simple altars, often made of wood, wire, and other materials found close at hand, are adorned with candles, dried herbs, coin, and pieces of carved whalebone known to possess a blessing from the Void.

Nevertheless, it is through these ritualized sites that contact with the Outsider is thought possible.\n\nHowever, many such attempts are failures.

Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m looking for Daud just like all of Dunwall was, years ago. Hope I have more luck than they did.<br /><br /><b>A long shot</b><br/><br/>One last lead: an underground boxing club, of all places. Daud could be fighting there. Maybe another dead end, but I have to be sure.<br /><br />I tried to pump out the engine room, but no use. My ship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dead in the water.

How long had he been down in that pit at the Albarca Baths, taunted like a hound until some fool thought they could take him on? They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know who he was. The Eyeless called him the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlack Magic Brute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122... There were more frightening names for him in Dunwall.<br /><br />I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what I expected, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t this. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d feel about me after what I did to him years ago. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like I never left. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re right back in the middle of it, digging into some foul cult, chasing down some mad grudge. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s older, now. Weaker.<br /><br /><b>The Outsider</b><br/><br/>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I need your help,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he said, like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never refuse. Well, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, did I?<br /><br />Mothers tell tales about the Outsider to children in cradles, filling their nights with fear so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll behave. For the Abbey, those stories never stop. Every sermon, every Stricture, every damn piece of their Litany is about the dangers of letting the Outsider into your head. And now Daud wants to kill him. No more stories, no more warnings. No more terrible people fighting over promises from the Void.<br /><br />I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how Daud got marked by the Outsider. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what he had to do, or what he was like before he had his magic. But I remember the kind of man it made him, and what he did with that power. So maybe he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right.<br /><br /><b>Breaking apart</b><br/><br/>The Outsider. The fucking Outsider himself, on my ship like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been waiting for me. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m writing this down with half a hand and an eye that will never shut again. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch them without shuddering. It feels just like the dreams.<br /><br />What did he see? Everything, if the Abbey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. He has to know what Daud and I are planning. Why tear half of me away? The Eyeless kill over scraps of magic, and now I can see where the world is cracking like a mirror.<br /><br />I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want any of this.<br /><br />(Does the Outsider always talk like that? Cryptic little shit. No wonder Daud hates him.)<br /><br /><b>Many eyes</b><br/><br/>Daud used to say that everything in Dunwall was tangled together. That nothing was a coincidence. Well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true for Karnaca too. The Eyeless might seem like a bunch of thugs trading bloody bones and foul recipes, but their coin flows from a richer vein.<br /><br />I found two of their leaders. Shan Yun, the Tyvian songbird, and Ivan Jacobi, a city administrator. They have the knife that killed the Outsider, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re keeping it hidden away behind lies and locked doors. But now I have their keys, and somewhere in Dolores Michaels' bank is a lock that needs turning. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the Eyeless stay hidden anymore.<br /><br /><b>Not myself</b><br/><br/>I see shadows everywhere this dead eye looks, and my right arm twitches and blurs as if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start moving on its own. These things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a part of me, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t escape them. The Outsider changed me into something I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand.<br /><br />In Dunwall, Daud taught me that no one was innocent, and gave me the means to judge them. Does the Outsider expect me to look down at him like I can look down at Karnaca, and hold his life in this broken hand? Does he want to see me carve up this city to find him?<br /><br />I know he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s watching. Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m staring right back.<br /><br /><b>The Twin-bladed Knife</b><br/><br/>Daud is dead. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left of him. Me, and this knife I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let go.<br /><br />Dolores Michaels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bank was a puzzle box of miserable secrets, and right at the center was the reason for it all. A woman taut to breaking and the knife she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tried to hide.<br /><br />The Outsider handed the knife to me himself. He wants to know what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to do with it. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out soon enough.<br /><br />(Why does this thing have two blades? Nothing ever gets stuck between them. None of this Void shit ever makes any sense.)<br /><br /><b>Alone again</b><br/><br/>I burned Daud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body today.<br /><br />When I left the Whalers, the rat plague was still piling corpses in the street. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anyone alive in those months who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learn grief. Even Daud nearly lost himself to it then. But I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose myself. Not now. Not again.<br /><br />When Deirdre died, who I was or what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done died too. No one else saw me like she did, no one until I met Daud and he gave me purpose again. When I left Dunwall, I let it heal over with lies. But my time back with Daud reopened that wound. All I can hope now is that I helped him in his final days, just like he helped me.<br /><br /><b>Stolen secrets</b><br/><br/>At the bank, I learned more about the pharmacist Cienfuegos. He was an Eyeless, and an artist too. He painted the Void, and was close to finding out how the cult leaders reach that place. He stole documents from Dolores Michaels and sent them to the Royal Conservatory. I need to find them, so I can see what he saw.<br /><br />His paintings are quiet, if a painting can be quiet. Quiet, but unsettled. He wanted to know everything. Uncover every secret. He was searching, just like me. And he was killed for it.<br /><br /><b>A broken coven</b><br/><br/>The last time I was in Cyria Gardens, the Royal Conservatory had become a nest for the same coven of witches I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d worked with in Dunwall years ago. The curator, Breanna Ashworth, and a group of women were living there, performing odd rituals with bones and glass. Now the Abbey of the Everyman and their witch-hunters have taken it over and are gutting the place of all traces of black magic. If I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m lucky, the documents I need haven't been burned yet.<br /><br />(When the Outsider is gone and the Overseers can't use him to prey on people's fears, I'll be there, laughing, as the Abbey falls to pieces.)<br /><br /><b>The way to Shindaerey North Quarry</b><br/><br/>I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never know exactly what Sister Rosewyn saw in her visions, but something made her hesitate. Something made her hold on to that silvergraph long enough for me to save it from the fire. The archive that Cienfuegos stole shows me exactly where the Void touches our world. Where I can reach the Outsider.<br /><br />I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what else I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find there. All the whispers and legends say something terrible. Something you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true until I reach it.<br /><br />(What do you pack for a journey to the Void? I just left everything behind.)<br /><br /><b>Leaving Karnaca</b><br/><br/>Every day Karnaca gets smaller. That swarming, stinking city, now nothing but a few lights in the distance. But I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look back anymore. The Void is closer with every step.<br /><br />It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet out here. Sometimes all I can hear is my own breath, my own heartbeat. It reminds me of being on the open ocean. Feeling like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the only one left alive. Feeling like the world won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back.<br /><br />Nothing but me and my thoughts.<br /><br/><b>My choice</b><br/><br/>Everything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done led me to this place, to this moment. Killing the Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother when I was a kid. Betraying Daud. Helping Emily retake the throne. But even then, I never felt important. I was always just another desperate person trying to make sense of her life.<br /><br />I watched my whole world being taken from me over and over. This time, I gave it all up on my own. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m climbing the mountain. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what waits for me there. But the Outsider is watching, and he knows it was my choice to go.<br /><br /><b>To the summit</b><br/><br/>The Outsider hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t known anything but hatred for thousands of years. He was killed to fulfill a purpose. No one asked him what he wanted. The lights went out in his world, and his eyes adjusted to the dark.<br /><br />I know what real loneliness is like. If it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been for Daud, I would have died from it. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m walking into the Void to face the loneliest creature in the world.
