They employed only about 1500 people. Where they distinguished themselves was in creating progressive, forward-thinking, custom-made mechanical augmentations. Their strength was innovation and it earned them the respect of the industry and the scientific community.<br /><br />The brainchild of founder David Sarif, Sarif Industries was poised to expand the human enhancement technology market to the masses when the Aug Incident occurred. It was their death knell.<br /><br />David Sarif himself was badly injured during the Incident. His company was eviscerated. Hit hard by regulatory measures, cancelled contracts, and anti-augmentation sentiment, Sarif Industries declared bankruptcy in 2028. Many of its assets were snatched up by Tai Yong Medical, one of the only augmentation producing companies to survive the industry's collapse.<br /><br /><b>L.I.M.B.</b><br/></br>Funded through government grants, corporate sponsorships, private endowments and bequests, Liberty in Mind and Body International, better known as L.I.M.B., was the populist face of the augmentation industry. Its mandate was to provide information, medical treatment, and outpatient care for anyone seeking to improve their quality of life through mechanical augmentation.<br /><br />When the Aug Incident hit, funding dried up overnight, and demand for augmentation surgery plummeted. Before long, many countries were passing laws prohibiting the installation of new augmentations.<br /><br />Within months, the majority of the 1900 L.I.M.B. clinics worldwide closed their doors. The few that are still open no longer perform augmentation surgery. Most are run by technicians who distribute Neuropozyne and may do minor maintenance on augmentations, and this, only where local governments allow.<br /><br />While human enhancement technology has not yet suffered a deathblow, it may be argued that the vanishing L.I.M.B. clinics portend the end of mechanical augmentations for the general public, at least for the foreseeable future.<br /><br /><b>Last Man Standing - Tai Yong Medical</b><br/></br>Prior to the Aug Incident, Tai Yong Medical was, depending on the source cited, either well on their way to becoming the largest mechanical augmentation producer in the world, or had already achieved the top rung.<br /><br />The loss of their dynamic CEO, Zhao Yun Ru, was a major blow. However, the biotech giant was bolstered by the support from the Chinese government, and they weathered the storm with much less upheaval than other human enhancement companies.<br /><br />With a new CEO at the helm (Shen Dian Fan), Tai Yong Medical has picked up where it left off before the Incident. They have spent the last two years acquiring and absorbing smaller biotech companies left high and dry in the wake of the disaster, including the dregs of their one-time rival Sarif Industries.<br /><br />Tai Yong continues to develop augmentations and augmentation-related technologies, mostly for military contracts.", "authors": ["Unknown[Deus Ex] "]}, {"id": "24581", "title": "The Juggernaut Collective (manifesto)", "text": "Manifesto<br /><br />We are Juggernaut.<br /><br />We are not anarchists.

Major economies crumbled in the wake of the event, and are still struggling to find purchase even two years later.<br /><br />The countries struck hardest follow the demographic spread of augmented peoplessic worldwide. As expected, First World nations were greatly impacted, mostly where the technological fields are concerned. Developing countries with burgeoning economies were also hit hard as infrastructure and construction were brought to a standstill.<br /><br />The gap, some pundits contend, may be filled by resource-rich third world nations that were left relatively untouched by the Incident. Politically speaking, many are as volatile as ever. However, many large multinationals are willing to take the risk, and have even taken to establishing joint politico-corporate governments in some smaller nations.<br /><br /><b> Chapter 4: The Australian Conflict</b><br/><br/>Following the Aug Incident, the opposing factions in the Australian Civil War\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthe northern Free States of Australia (FSA) and the ruling South Australia Federation (SAF)\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwere effectively forced into a ceasefire. Since 2028 there has still been the occasional border skirmish, but for the most part the violence has been held at bay, at least in the populated cities along the coastline. The interior is a different matter.<br /><br />The outback is still disputed. At best, it is a desolate wasteland, at worst, a lawless expanse slowly killing off augmented PMC soldiers who fled there to die rather than confront the after-effects of horrifying, psychotic delusions. The two interim governments have formed a joint Police Force to patrol the interior, but by all accounts their impact has been negligible.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 5: The Fall of the American Empire?</b><br/><br/>The Aug Incident has served to further widen existing failures in the American union.<br /><br />Increasingly draconian measures enacted by the government to establish order have done little but smoke the fires of extremism and goad the indolent disconnected into action. The gulf between the haves and have-nots continues to widen. Radical constitutionalist groups have taken to militant action, and intimations of secession have been heard from various quarters of the continental US, particularly in the Northwest states and Texas.<br /><br />There is little to suggest that the United States will be able to claw its way out of this chasm in the near future.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 6: South America's Rise to Power?</b><br/><br/>The riots stemming from the Aug Incident struck many of the South American nations without warning, with similar effects to those seen in the rest of the world. However, the chaos was confined to the major cities and the less urbanized areas of the continent remained relatively untouched by the events.<br /><br />A disproportionately strong response from paramilitary and police forces crushed most of the rampaging augs within a very short period of time; this, coupled with a far lower percentage of human augmentations present in the South American region, has allowed countries such as Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina to regain order much more quickly than other, more \"developed\" nations.<br /><br />In the aftermath, the governments of these countries are now seeking to make the most of the economic slump being experienced by First World nations, expanding to fill the gap in the world's marketplace before their larger rivals can recover.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 7: Crouching Dragon</b><br/><br/>As the single largest nation state on Earth with the biggest population of augmented humans, the mayhem wrought by the Aug Incident had the potential to virtually cripple the People's Republic overnight, but more than any other nation in the world, China was ready for an event on the scale of the aug rampage and it moved swiftly to contain and eradicate the rioters with lethal intent. While there was substantial loss of life and damage to infrastructure, the PRC have been quick to rebuild and regain the momentum they lost.<br /><br />Civilian unrest and demands for explanations have been silenced, and state-controlled media ensures that the blame for the events of 2027 remain firmly on the shoulders of the West.<br /><br /><b>Chapter 8: Africa</b><br/><br/>The Aug Incident left Africa largely untouched, thanks to the limited number of augmented humans across the continent; and like several of the nations in South America, many of the African nation-states saw an opportunity to step up and fill the economic gap left by struggling First World nations. However, the presence of many Chinese interests on the continent has so far held this in check.<br /><br />Perhaps the most direct effect of what happened with the Augs has been the migration of augmented refugees from the European Union and Eastern European states; Africa's comparatively lax regulations on HET (human enhancement technology) has seen a strong influx of augs, fleeing the prohibitive new laws coming into effect elsewhere.

Union concerns questioned their use of cheap immigrant labor, while rumors of cheap materials swirled through the media. The project was a success, though, and the company parlayed its earnings into a number of water treatment and supply contracts throughout France and neighboring countries. The contracts proved to be quite lucrative.<br /><br /><b>Growth</b><br/><br/>Santeau's initial successes allowed them to quickly grow into an international company. Their early strategy for growth and a prosperous future was the acquisition of land\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgreat swaths of cheap land in various countries around the world. Useless land, it was thought. Land in the middle of nowhere. However, much of the acreage was lying atop fresh water aquifers.<br /><br />By the early 2000's, Santeau Water was the major water treatment and supply conglomerate on the globe and controlled much of the planet's fresh water. The Water Wars were already won before they had ever begun.<br /><br />For the next 25 years Santeau Environmental acquired smaller companies and influence. Their expansion was meteoric and their rise funded many fortunes. When the dart's population boomed beyond the 10 billion mark, Santeau was in position to take advantage. They diversified. Agriculture was the new game and they had thousands of acres of land ready to be cultivated.<br /><br />Their water distribution infrastructure already in place, Santeau effectively became the world leader in food production and distribution virtually overnight.

Their most lucrative decision was to expand their interest into infrastructure construction and civil engineering, specializing in post-conflict areas and war-torn nations.<br /><br />Santeau helped rebuild and rehabilitate critical human infrastructure in the Middle East after the Pan-Arab invasion of Israel.
