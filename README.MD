# video-game-text-dataset
Collected in-game text like notes, letters, codex entries, and audio recordings into JSON format.

## Datasets
The data used to created these datasets was collected from a variety of sources (wikis, transcribing, finding in-game files w/ the data) for [LibraryofCodexes](https://libraryofcodexes.com/). There are bound to be some mistakes but I've tried to sanatize the text the best I can.  

All datasets are in JSON format.
